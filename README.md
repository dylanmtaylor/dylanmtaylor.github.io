## About this repository

I decided to scrap my WordPress blog and recreate my whole site from scratch, publishing it all to GitHub for others to study and learn from. I'm using Jekyll for blogging, and the rest of the site is using code that was written by hand. This repository contains the complete source code for my website, which is automatically compiled and build by Travis CI when I make a new commit.
