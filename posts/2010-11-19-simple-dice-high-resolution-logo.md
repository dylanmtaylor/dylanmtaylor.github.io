Continuing the pattern of updating all of my [Android](http://code.google.com/android/) applications to include the new, mandatory [high-resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution) application icons, I've been working on a new logo for my [dice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice) rolling application, Simple Dice. After messing around with it for a while, I finally managed to come up with something that looks great, and is unique when compared to my other high resolution application icons. This new icon makes use of the "[What Do We Do All Day](http://oohlalaartsy.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-free-font-what-do-we-do-all-day.html)" font by [Heather Taylor](http://oohlalaartsy.blogspot.com/) (no relation to me). I used a spiral background to visually symbolize the movement of rolling the dice, and layered a few copies of the dice image on top of each other in order to create an almost three dimensional look and feel, as well as a subtle glow behind the text and the [die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice) itself. I will be using this new high resolution icon for both the free version and the $0.99 donation (advertisement-free) version of Simple Dice in the [Android market](http://www.android.com/market/).
