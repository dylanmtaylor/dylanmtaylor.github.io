For all of you who don't have an [Android](http://code.google.com/android/) device, it's been difficult to calculate a default [FiOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS) [WEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy) key using your [mobile phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone). Well not any more! Now if you visit the [FiOS WEP Calculator website](http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com) on any [mobile device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device), as long as your device supports [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), you can calculate a default WEP key (I'm also planning on porting the script to [PHP](http://www.php.net/), and using server-side calculations for devices that don't support JavaScript in the future). The mobile optimized version is *incredibly* lightweight, with no [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) files (all styles are embedded in the main page) or images, what-so-ever, and all unnecessary formatting in the source code removed. On a 3G connection, the page should easily load in under 1 second almost every time (the entire page is less than 3kb). I believe that this new website will make it significantly easier for users of every mobile platform to use FiOS WEP calculator on the go. To check it out, visit **goo.gl/D6P5x** on your mobile phone, or scan the following QR code:
