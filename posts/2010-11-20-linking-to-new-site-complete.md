<p>I just finished adding links at the top of all of my posts on my old blog that point to the this site. Hopefully people and <a class="zem_slink" title="Web search engine" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine">search engines</a> will see these and realize that the site has moved to a new domain. Adding those links was very tedious, but overall, I think it was worth it, as it gives this site a lot more visibility.</p>
