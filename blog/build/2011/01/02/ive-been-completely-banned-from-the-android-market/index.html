	<h1>I've Been Completely BANNED From the Android Market</h1>
	<p class="meta">02 Jan 2011</p>
	<p>In case you were wondering where <em>all</em> of my <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software' rel='wikipedia' title='Application software'>applications</a> went, <a class='zem_slink' href='http://google.com' rel='homepage' title='Google'>Google</a> decided to suspend my entire account and all applications on it on December 29th, 2010 at 8:46 PM (<a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time' rel='wikipedia' title='Coordinated Universal Time'>UTC</a>). This is very disappointing, frustrating, and depressing, especially since I am no longer allowed to <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uploading_and_downloading' rel='wikipedia' title='Uploading and downloading'>upload</a> any new Android applications. I believe that Google went too far and should have only suspended the infringing applications instead of banning my entire account, since I had many legitimate, non-infringing applications on it, such as EliteGuard, <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate' rel='wikipedia' title='Exchange rate'>Currency Converter</a>, Simple Dice, Find the Mouse, and InfiniteSMS (I don't believe simply removing the <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS' rel='wikipedia' title='SMS'>SMS</a> sending limit qualifies as infringement). Here is the message I have received from the <a class='zem_slink' href='http://www.android.com/market/' rel='homepage' title='Android Market'>Android Market</a> Support Team:</p><blockquote><p>Hello Dylan,</p>
<p>After a regular account review, your Android Market Publisher account has<br />
been suspended due to multiple violations of our <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service' rel='wikipedia' title='Terms of service'>Terms of Service</a>. You may<br />
view these terms here:</p>
<p><a href='http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html' target='_blank'>http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html</a> (Section<br />
4.4).<br />
<a href='http://www.android.com/market/terms/developer-content-policy.html' target='_blank'>http://www.android.com/market/terms/developer-content-policy.html</a></p>
<p>Please note that Android Market Publisher suspensions are associated with<br />
developers, and may span multiple accounts.</p>
<p>We are not inclined to reverse this decision.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
The Android Market Team</p></blockquote><p>An hour after receiving this message from Google, I decided to try to appeal the ban, with an apology letter directed toward the Android Market team. As of January 3rd, 2011, I have not received any reply from them at all. A copy of my response to them is below:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Android Market Support,</p>
<p>In addition to the applications that  infringe upon your terms of service, I had many 'legitimate'  applications listed that cause no harm to any devices or networks, or  infringe on your terms of service in any way. I would like to appeal  your decision to suspend <a class='zem_slink' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_%28computing%29' rel='wikipedia' title='User (computing)'>my account</a>, and I would like to request a  specific list of infringing applications and how they infringe upon your  terms of service so that I can remove those particular applications  from the market if I am given another chance to distribute my  applications on the Android market. Although you say that I have  multiple violations of your terms of service, the only application I  wrote that I am aware may potentially infringe on your terms of service  is "EliteBomb", my text-bombing application, of which I had multiple  versions listed. When I uploaded this application, I was not aware that  it was against your terms of service, and I would like to apologize for  any misunderstandings. I realize that you don't have to unsuspend my  developer account, but given another chance, I would like to keep my  applications that do not infringe on your terms of service listed, and  upload more applications in the future. I have no intention of abusing  the privilege of uploading Android applications. I will not upload  another text bombing application, given the chance, without your prior  consent.<br />

I truly would like to continue to develop and support my applications for Android, but it does not look like Google will allow me the privilege of doing so, so I shall begin to look into alternative means of distribution. This is a truly disappointing and sorrowful moment for me. :-(</span></span></p><div class='zemanta-pixie' style='margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;'><img alt='' class='zemanta-pixie-img' src='/images/blog/2011/06/pixy9.gif' style='border: medium none; float: right;' /></div>
