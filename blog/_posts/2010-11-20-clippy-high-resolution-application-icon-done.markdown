<p>Because of the professional nature of Clippy, my <a title="Clipboard (software)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Clipboard_%28software%29">clipboard<&#47;a> management application, in comparison to some of my other applications, I decided to go with a really simple, yet elegant and polished look on this one. Because I recreated the original Clippy icon as a scalable <a class="zem_slink" title="Vector graphics" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Vector_graphics">vector image<&#47;a>, creating this new icon was a piece of cake, and there's literally no loss of quality at all. Most of the work was playing with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Drop shadow" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Drop_shadow">drop shadow<&#47;a> behind the clipboard until it looked just right. This new icon is already up on the Android Market as I'm writing this post.</p>

<p>As always, I'm interested in knowing your opinion on my icons and other artwork, and I will take them into consideration when working on future projects.</p>
