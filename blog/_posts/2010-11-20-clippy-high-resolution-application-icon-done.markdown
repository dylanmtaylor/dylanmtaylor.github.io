  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

<p>Because of the professional nature of Clippy, my <a title="Clipboard (software)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Clipboard_%28software%29">clipboard<&#47;a> management application, in comparison to some of my other applications, I decided to go with a really simple, yet elegant and polished look on this one. Because I recreated the original Clippy icon as a scalable <a class="zem_slink" title="Vector graphics" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Vector_graphics">vector image<&#47;a>, creating this new icon was a piece of cake, and there's literally no loss of quality at all. Most of the work was playing with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Drop shadow" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Drop_shadow">drop shadow<&#47;a> behind the clipboard until it looked just right. This new icon is already up on the Android Market as I'm writing this post.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-900" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;20&#47;clippy-high-resolution-application-icon-done&#47;clippy-high-resolution-application-icon&#47;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-900" title="Clippy High Resolution Application Icon" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;Clippy-High-Resolution-Application-Icon-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>As always, I'm interested in knowing your opinion on my icons and other artwork, and I will take them into consideration when working on future projects.</p>
