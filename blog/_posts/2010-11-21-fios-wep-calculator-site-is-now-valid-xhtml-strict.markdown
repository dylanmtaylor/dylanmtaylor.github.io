<p>I've been working on optimizing theÂ <a href="http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com">FiOS WEP Calculator website</a> for a while now, reducing the sizes of the image files, and reducing the amount of code, in order to get the page to load faster on slower connections. After messing around with the <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a> for a while, I can finally say that I managed to get the page to be <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffwc.dylanmtaylor.com%2F;ss=1;st=1;outline=1;No200=1;verbose=1;group=1">100% valid XHTML Strict</a>! Having a page that's valid XHTML is important, since it ensures that the page will work properly in as many browsers as possible. I also took the liberty of adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Meta element" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element">meta tags</a> for description and keywords, so that the site will look better in search engine result pages.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The site is now extremely optimized in order to reduce page loading time, especially on slower Internet connections, such as dial-up for those of you who still have it.</p>
