<p>You may remember that, a very long time ago,  I created a <a class="zem_slink" title="Java (software platform)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28software_platform%29">Java application</a> that calculates the default <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> keys of most Verizon <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a> routers (I have <a href="/pages/blog/2010/07/29/fios-wep-calculator/">a blog post about it</a> on this blog). I had the application and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fioswepcalc.webs.com/">the site for it</a> hosted on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.webs.com/">Webs</a>. Needless to say, Webs is terrible for hosting anything serious, and the old <a class="zem_slink" title="Website" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">website</a> I had was very basic, and only  a single page. Despite the ridiculously simple layout of the site, the complete lack of any kind of manual <a class="zem_slink" title="Search engine optimization" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">search engine optimization</a>, what-so-ever, and any content other than a download for the FiOS WEP Calculator application, my FiOS WEP Calculator site has maintained the number one spot in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Search" rel="homepage" href="http://Google.com">Google search</a> results for "FiOS WEP Calculator" for over a year, and has received a very large number of hits and downloads. Today, I'm proud to announce that I have finished the process of moving the site over to my new domain, with <a href="http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com">it's own subdomain on this website</a>. All of the old content is still on Webs, but the main page that contains the link now contains <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaScript" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code that redirects all visitors to the new website. In addition to that, I added a note on the page, after the previous description of the applicaiton for all users of browsers without JavaScript support, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Update: I now have my own dedicated domain name! <a class="fw_link_website" href="http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com" target="_self">Click here to visit the new site</a>!</p></blockquote>
<p>This will ensure that if anybody linked to the old website, all visitors will know that I migrated to a new domain name, and likely bring more traffic to this website. As of today, I am proud to announce that <a href="http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com/">my new FiOS WEP Calculator website</a> is now the number one result for a Google search of "FiOS WEP Calculator".</p>
