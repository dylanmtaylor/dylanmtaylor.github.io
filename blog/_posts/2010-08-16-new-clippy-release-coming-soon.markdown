  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizationTipz.com\"

    Genital herpes could potentially cause distressing genital blisters and are extreme
    in folks who suffer from suppressed defense systems. Obtaining sores as well as
    other outward warning signs of herpes can increase your threat of growing the
    infection.

    a few of your posts. Many of them are rife with spelling issues and I find it
    very bothersome to inform the truth then again I'll surely come back again.

<p>I've been working hard on Clippy's new look, and it's getting better and more useful all the time! Expect to see a new major release in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a> soon! There is still, however, some functionality that I don't have implemented yet, that I hope to get working soon. However, I am unable to find any significant regressions in functionality since the current version in the market, so I don't think I have much to worry about in terms of things not working right. However, I would like to get some more things working, and add some more features to the interface to make it easier to use. The interface is turning out really nicely so far. In fact, it's getting so good that it might as well be a standalone <a class="zem_slink" title="Text editor" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Text_editor">text editor<&#47;a>, as it's quickly gaining quite a broad range of functionality. I was actually considering reusing a large portion of the code, and making another application dedicated to editing text, since they would share a common <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Source_code">code base<&#47;a>, but first I have to get more work done on Clippy.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong> I'm working on preparing the next iteration of the Clippy Public Beta for release right now. Expect to see it in the market soon.</p>
