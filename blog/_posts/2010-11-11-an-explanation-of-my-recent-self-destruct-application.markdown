    Interesting. It's great seeing programmers like yourself going out-of-the-box to try and come up with new methods to do various things. Although I'm not an android programmer myself (I'm an iPhone programmer) I still enjoy getting ideas from other programmers.

    So are android apps programmed purely in javascript?

    remove from the launcher (which your code does after a launcher restart) but for
    the app to still be available wen called via the intent of another app. \r\n\r\nIn
    other words I want to use COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE_DISABLED to diable <em>only<&#47;em>
    android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's only a small modification
    to your code, but I'm only just started coding myself. Any ideas?"

  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

This application demonstrates a way to create an application that is able to "destroy" itself, preventing it from running until it is uninstalled, and then reinstalled later. I'd like to personally thank <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.handlerexploit.com&#47;">HandlerExploit<&#47;a> for giving me a hint about how to do this (he mentioned that he found the trick in the provisioning code). HandlerExploit uses a similar technique in his application, "iBrick Proof of Concept". As soon as the user opens the application, it removes it's main class from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Dalvik (software)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Dalvik_%28software%29">Dalvik<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Package management system" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Package_management_system">package manager<&#47;a>, preventing itself from being able to run again. The only way to run the application again after opening it is to uninstall the application, and reinstall it. This application serves no real purpose other than to demonstrate an interesting trick, and it is not malicious in any way. Please note that after running the application, it's icon will remain in the launcher, although you won't be able to open it. Uninstalling the application will remove the icon. I'd release the entire <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Source_code">source code<&#47;a> for this application, but really, the only part that actually matters is the part that removes the class from Dalvik and prevents the application from running again. Interestingly, this application requires absolutely no permissions, at all in order to do this. In case you are interested in how I did this, here is the source code for the main class in the project:</p>
<pre>package com.dylantaylor.selfdestruct;<br />
import android.app.Activity;<br />
import android.content.ComponentName;<br />
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;<br />
import android.os.Bundle;</p>

    &#47;** Called when the activity is first created. *&#47;<br />
    @Override<br />
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {<br />
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);<br />
        setContentView(R.layout.main);<br />
