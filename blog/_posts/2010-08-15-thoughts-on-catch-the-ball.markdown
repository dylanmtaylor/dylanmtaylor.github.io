<p>I haven't written very much about Catch The Ball lately, so I thought I'd take some time to do so. The project is <em>not</em> dead, and I have several plans for what I'm going to change when I resume working on it. I want to make the game more fun and exciting, so here is a list of several improvements that I have been planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user successfully catches the ball, I want to display an <a class="zem_slink" title="Animation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation">animated</a> image of the ball exploding, or something more interesting.</li>
<li>I plan on getting the difficulty selection to work properly</li>
<li>I'm going to add an options menu, which will allow you to toggle the "guides" on andÂ  off</li>
<li>I will also have a set difficulty preference, which will allow the user to change the difficulty. This will allow me to clean up the main menu a bit, since I won't have to have the difficulty selection there.</li>
<li>I will allow the user to choose whether the game will be rendered horizontally or vertically. Based on this decision, I will display the game's status on the "top" of the screen.</li>
<li>I plan on adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Sound effect" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect">sound effects</a>. Since I don't really have any means of producing these myself, I will probably incorporate <a class="zem_slink" title="Public domain" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">public domain</a> sounds. In particular, I want to have sound effects when the ball is successfully caught, and when the ball bounces off of the walls.</li>
<li>I will finally get the game's timer working, and have the current level and time remaining displayed on the screen. I will also make adjustments to the time given to the player, in order to make it possible to beat the game on all <a class="zem_slink" title="Difficulty level" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difficulty_level">difficulty levels</a>, and provide a pleasant experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently busy working on Clippy, but look forward to seeing an update to Catch The Ball in the future. After all, it <em>is</em> an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> project, so even if I completely abandon it, someone else can take over the work.</p>
