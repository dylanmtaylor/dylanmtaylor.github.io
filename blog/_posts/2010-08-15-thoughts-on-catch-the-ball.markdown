<p>I haven't written very much about Catch The Ball lately, so I thought I'd take some time to do so. The project is <em>not<&#47;em> dead, and I have several plans for what I'm going to change when I resume working on it. I want to make the game more fun and exciting, so here is a list of several improvements that I have been planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user successfully catches the ball, I want to display an <a class="zem_slink" title="Animation" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Animation">animated<&#47;a> image of the ball exploding, or something more interesting.<&#47;li>
<li>I plan on getting the difficulty selection to work properly<&#47;li>
<li>I'm going to add an options menu, which will allow you to toggle the "guides" on and&Acirc;&nbsp; off<&#47;li>
<li>I will also have a set difficulty preference, which will allow the user to change the difficulty. This will allow me to clean up the main menu a bit, since I won't have to have the difficulty selection there.<&#47;li>
<li>I will allow the user to choose whether the game will be rendered horizontally or vertically. Based on this decision, I will display the game's status on the "top" of the screen.<&#47;li>
<li>I plan on adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Sound effect" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Sound_effect">sound effects<&#47;a>. Since I don't really have any means of producing these myself, I will probably incorporate <a class="zem_slink" title="Public domain" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Public_domain">public domain<&#47;a> sounds. In particular, I want to have sound effects when the ball is successfully caught, and when the ball bounces off of the walls.<&#47;li>
<li>I will finally get the game's timer working, and have the current level and time remaining displayed on the screen. I will also make adjustments to the time given to the player, in order to make it possible to beat the game on all <a class="zem_slink" title="Difficulty level" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Difficulty_level">difficulty levels<&#47;a>, and provide a pleasant experience.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I'm currently busy working on Clippy, but look forward to seeing an update to Catch The Ball in the future. After all, it <em>is<&#47;em> an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open source<&#47;a> project, so even if I completely abandon it, someone else can take over the work.</p>
