  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

    but I am not losing. I stay under 20 gr carbs. I dont want to go back to eating
    carbs as I have issues with them, I pig out when I allow myself to eat them, my
    moods are terrible and my depression seems worse when I consume carbs. I dont
    have much to lose and I lift weights and do HIIT but my weight is just standing
    still, any help or advice will be very helpful.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

<p>I haven't written very much about Catch The Ball lately, so I thought I'd take some time to do so. The project is <em>not<&#47;em> dead, and I have several plans for what I'm going to change when I resume working on it. I want to make the game more fun and exciting, so here is a list of several improvements that I have been planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user successfully catches the ball, I want to display an <a class="zem_slink" title="Animation" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Animation">animated<&#47;a> image of the ball exploding, or something more interesting.<&#47;li>
<li>I plan on getting the difficulty selection to work properly<&#47;li>
<li>I'm going to add an options menu, which will allow you to toggle the "guides" on and&Acirc;&nbsp; off<&#47;li>
<li>I will also have a set difficulty preference, which will allow the user to change the difficulty. This will allow me to clean up the main menu a bit, since I won't have to have the difficulty selection there.<&#47;li>
<li>I will allow the user to choose whether the game will be rendered horizontally or vertically. Based on this decision, I will display the game's status on the "top" of the screen.<&#47;li>
<li>I plan on adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Sound effect" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Sound_effect">sound effects<&#47;a>. Since I don't really have any means of producing these myself, I will probably incorporate <a class="zem_slink" title="Public domain" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Public_domain">public domain<&#47;a> sounds. In particular, I want to have sound effects when the ball is successfully caught, and when the ball bounces off of the walls.<&#47;li>
<li>I will finally get the game's timer working, and have the current level and time remaining displayed on the screen. I will also make adjustments to the time given to the player, in order to make it possible to beat the game on all <a class="zem_slink" title="Difficulty level" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Difficulty_level">difficulty levels<&#47;a>, and provide a pleasant experience.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I'm currently busy working on Clippy, but look forward to seeing an update to Catch The Ball in the future. After all, it <em>is<&#47;em> an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open source<&#47;a> project, so even if I completely abandon it, someone else can take over the work.</p>
