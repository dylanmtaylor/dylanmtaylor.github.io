  content: Hi! I know this is kinda off topic nevertheless I'd figured I'd ask. Would
    you be interested in trading links or maybe guest writing a blog article or vice-versa?
    My website covers a lot of the same subjects as yours and I feel we could greatly
    benefit from each other. If you might be interested feel free to send me an e-mail.
    I look forward to hearing from you! Awesome blog by the way!

<p>If you haven't heard of ROME's <a title="3 Dreams of Black Demo" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ro.me&#47;">3 Dreams of Black&Acirc;&nbsp;WebGL demo<&#47;a>, you should seriously check this out. It's an interactive music-video like experience that is rendered in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Web browser" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Web_browser" rel="wikipedia">web browser<&#47;a> in real-time using <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaScript" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;JavaScript" rel="wikipedia">JavaScript<&#47;a> and WebGL. Because it's <a class="zem_slink" title="Hardware acceleration" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Hardware_acceleration" rel="wikipedia">hardware accelerated<&#47;a>, it allows for insanely complex, dynamic, and interactive graphics to be rendered right within your web browser. Of course, you will need to be using a modern web browser for this to work, such as the latest version of <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Chrome" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;chrome" rel="homepage">Google Chrome<&#47;a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Firefox" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.com&#47;firefox&#47;" rel="homepage">Mozilla Firefox<&#47;a> (5 was just recently released), <a class="zem_slink" title="Opera Software" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.opera.com" rel="homepage">Opera<&#47;a>, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Safari" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;safari&#47;" rel="homepage">Safari<&#47;a>. Unfortunately, Internet Explorer does <em>not<&#47;em> support WebGL, which is required to view this demo. Also, this is an open source project, so all of the source code is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;3-dreams-of-black&#47;">available on Google Code<&#47;a>. 3 Dreams of Black is more than just a music video. It offers a look at the future of the web, where open web technologies can be used to create interactive experiences never before thought possible, all through a web browser. If you have a modern graphics card that supports a reasonably modern version of the <a class="zem_slink" title="OpenGL" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.opengl.org&#47;" rel="homepage">OpenGL<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Application programming interface" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Application_programming_interface" rel="wikipedia">API<&#47;a>, I highly recommend playing with this demo. For the rest of you, there is a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=ReH7zzj5GPc">video on YouTube<&#47;a> that shows off the demo.</p>
