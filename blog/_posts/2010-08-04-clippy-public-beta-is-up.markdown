  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

Go ahead and check it out, and let me know what you think! :) I'm particularly surprised at how well the artwork for this came out... I really didn't expect it to end up as good as it did. Granted, the artwork could be significantly improved, I think it came out looking pretty nice. I'm going to update this post and add some screenshots, and I'll add them to the Android market as well. I've been working on coding this for the past few days, and I really must say, I'm impressed with how well this is turning out. Perhaps this will turn into a really useful tool for <a class="zem_slink" title="Power user" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Power_user">power users<&#47;a>. I plan on updating Clippy fairly frequently due to it's extremely early state of development, so brace yourselves for a bunch of rapid <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_interface">user interface<&#47;a> changes. Keep an eye out for the some of the following additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional text filters<&#47;li>
<li>Ability to view clipping information<&#47;li>
<li>Ability to edit the clipping without leaving the clippings tab and creating a new clipping<&#47;li>
<li>Additional clipping <a class="zem_slink" title="Metadata" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Metadata">metadata<&#47;a> such as "Creation Time" and "Last Modified"<&#47;li>
<li>Added clipping statistics, such as word count and character count<&#47;li>
<li>Ability to click URLs in clippings<&#47;li>
<li>Better clipping organization<&#47;li>
<li>The ability to rename clippings<&#47;li>
<li>And many more possible additions<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
