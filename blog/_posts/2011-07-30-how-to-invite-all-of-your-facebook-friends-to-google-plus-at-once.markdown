<p>Using a neat little trick, I managed to send everyone on my <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" href="http://facebook.com" rel="homepage">Facebook</a> friend list a <a href="http://dylanmtaylor.com/+">Google+</a> invite. In this post, I'll show you how to do that. It's actually quite simple. If you don't have a <a title="Gmail" href="http://gmail.com/" rel="homepage">GMail</a> account, this will still work for small amounts of contacts, but you need to use a <a class="zem_slink" title="Gmail" href="http://gmail.com" rel="homepage">GMail</a> account to process and invite all of your contacts at once.  First, if you don't already have a <a class="zem_slink" title="Yahoo!" href="http://www.yahoo.com" rel="homepage">Yahoo</a> account, sign up for one. Otherwise, sign in and go to <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo Mail</a>. The reason this works is because Yahoo and Facebook have some kind of partnership. Once logged in, go to the "Contacts" tab. Click "Import Contacts", and choose the "Facebook" option. Allow Yahoo access to your Facebook contacts. On my account, it only imported 100 contacts the first time. After the second try, I had all 257 of my Facebook contacts imported. Now that you have your contacts imported, go back to the "Contacts" tab. Click "Actions", and choose "Export All...". When asked, export as a "<a class="zem_slink" title="Yahoo!" href="http://www.yahoo.com" rel="homepage">Yahoo!</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Comma-separated values" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" rel="wikipedia">CSV</a>" file, and remember where you saved that. You will need it later. Now go to <a href="http://google.com/contacts">Google Contacts</a>. Create a new group called "Facebook". Once you have a "Facebook" group, click the "Import" link on the upper right of the page. Select the Yahoo .csv file, and make sure to choose to import it into the newly created "Facebook" group. Now that you have all of your contacts imported, if you don't have GMail, select all of your contacts and choose "Email", otherwise go to GMail and login to that. In GMail, click "Contacts" and then click the "Facebook" group. Click the checkbox above the list of contacts to select them all at once. Now click the "Email" button. You will now see all of your contacts in the "To" field of GMail or your email client. Copy the entire list, and paste it into the Google+ invite form. Click invite. Congratulations, you just invited <em>all</em> of your Facebook friends to join Google+.</p>
