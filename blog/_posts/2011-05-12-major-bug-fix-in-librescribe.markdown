<p>A lot of work on the LibreScribe project has been accomplished since I first wrote about it. Just today, I fixed a major regression which was preventing the device information dialog from being displayed. In addition to that, I now have more work done on the interface, so that when the windows is resized, most of the elements will scale properly to fit the new size. Another major change I made was setting up the layout of the "Audio" and "Applications" tabs, so that there are now lists, with data split into columns. These changes mark a significant improvement in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Look and feel" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_feel">look and feel</a> of LibreScribe, but it's only the beginning. Expect a large number of major changes in the not-too-distant future.</p>
