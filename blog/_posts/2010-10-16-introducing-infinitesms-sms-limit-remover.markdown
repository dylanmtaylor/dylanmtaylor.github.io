  content: The only thing I've ever wanted to change in this application is for us
    to have the ability to completely hide the sender's address. With no way of someone
    being able to tell who sent the text or what program was used to send the text.
    Do that and I'd gladly pay lots of of money for an app like that. Hell I'd pay
    twenty dollars for a program that could do that. Please email me and let me know
    if you can do that.thanks.

  content: I do believe all the concepts you've introduced to your post. They are
    very convincing and can certainly work. Still, the posts are very brief for novices.
    Could you please extend them a little from subsequent time? Thank you for the
    post.

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;10&#47;infinitesms-logo1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-670" title="InfiniteSMS Logo" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;10&#47;infinitesms-logo1.png?w=300" alt="" width="210" height="210" &#47;><&#47;a>I get quite a few emails from my users offering suggestions, and one of those suggestions was to create a standalone application dedicated to removing the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS<&#47;a> sending limitations of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android operating system<&#47;a>, without all the clutter of a text bombing application such as EliteBomb. So, judging by the title of this post, you can probably infer that I did just that. It was a simple enough task, since I already had most of the code I needed already in EliteBomb, so all that I needed to do was create a simple logo, write up a (very) basic, yet intuitive interface, and write up some messages that will be displayed to the user. So, if for some reason, you'd prefer not to use EliteBomb to remove your SMS sending limitations, InfiniteSMS is now available to download from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a>. Because the code of InfiniteSMS is largely based off of the EliteBomb's SMS limitation removal code, if EliteBomb failed to remove the SMS sending limitations of your device, it isn't very likely that InfiniteSMS will succeed, but you are always free to try. When I discover how to get the limitation removal to work on Android 2.2 devices, the limitation fix will be released first for EliteBomb Plus, but I will release it for the regular version of EliteBomb and InfiniteSMS shortly after. However, if you have Android 2.1 or earlier, both of these applications should work just fine. As always, removing the SMS limitation requires a rooted device.</p>
