  content: "When I was younger, I could go low carb and would feel great after a couple
    of days. Now, for some reason, that I'm into my 50's and menopausal, if I eat
    low carb, I have terrible anxiety. Sweet potato, rice, etc., are not helpful on
    their own. It's rather frustrating. Wondering about the weight loss thing. Husband,
    daughter and self went low carb < 20 g per day 9 months ago. Husband lost substantially
    (25 lbs) - he is most active too. Daughter lost pounds (25 lbs), inches and her
    weight distribution shifted. My weight loss was 5 lbs at first then went back,
    have some muscle, and now legs esp. thighs are larger - seemingly no more weight
    loss. What happened? High fat, low carb adherence, no cheating. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nhttps:&#47;&#47;delicious.com&#47;colog268"

    wrote the book in it or something. I think that you can do with a few pics to
    drive the message home a little bit, but instead of that, this is great blog.
    A fantastic read. I'll definitely be back.

I removed the old Pro version because I originally published it for free, and I wasn't making any money. I only made $0.57 so far with <a class="zem_slink" title="AdMob" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;admob.com">AdMob<&#47;a>, and that's almost nothing at all. I don't really like charging very much for my applications, so the Pro version of FiOS WEP Calculator is now available for only<strong> $0.99<&#47;strong>! If you use&#47;like this application, please consider purchasing the "PRO"  version. The PRO version has all the same features as the Lite version,  except it doesn't have any advertisement, it uses absolutely no copy  protection what-so-ever I don't believe in locking down my products with  worthless DRM -- if you buy it, feel free to use it on as many phones  as you want. I don't mind that much if you pirate this application, but really,  please consider purchasing it. It only costs $0.99, which is the  minimum amount you can sell an application for on the app store, and of  those $0.99, I only make <strong>$0.66<&#47;strong> ($0.30 processing fee + 2.9% of sale  price). Your purchase supports the development of this application, and  all of the other <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android<&#47;a> projects I'm working on. I code applications as  a hobby, and not just for profit. If you don't pay for the application,  please at least rate it and leave a positive review if you like it!  Thanks for your support! :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: <&#47;strong>If you area looking for the free, but advertisement supported version, it's called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;07&#47;30&#47;fios-wep-calculator-lite-edition-is-up-and-running&#47;">FiOS WEP Calculator Lite<&#47;a>. Please consider purchasing the 'Pro' version to support future development. Thanks! :)</p>
