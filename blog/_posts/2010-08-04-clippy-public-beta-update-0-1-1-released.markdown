<p>I just uploaded a new version of Clippy Public Beta. I believe that I found out what was causing Clippy to force close. This new update should fix the force close issues that some users have been experiencing. If you continue to have any issues, let me know either through the comment form on my blog, or by sending me an email. Enjoy! :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong> The application now launches as it's supposed to, but clicking the About tab seems to cause it to force close. A fix is in the works!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:<&#47;strong> The issues is fixed in version 0.1.2! :)</p>
