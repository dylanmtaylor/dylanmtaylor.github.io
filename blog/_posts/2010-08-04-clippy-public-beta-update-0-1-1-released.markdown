    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,

<p>I just uploaded a new version of Clippy Public Beta. I believe that I found out what was causing Clippy to force close. This new update should fix the force close issues that some users have been experiencing. If you continue to have any issues, let me know either through the comment form on my blog, or by sending me an email. Enjoy! :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong> The application now launches as it's supposed to, but clicking the About tab seems to cause it to force close. A fix is in the works!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:<&#47;strong> The issues is fixed in version 0.1.2! :)</p>
