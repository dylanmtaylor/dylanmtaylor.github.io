<p>I realize that "Find The Mouse" isn't that much fun yet. I'm working on implementing a feature to keep track of scoring. For each round successfully completed, you will get one point plus one point for every click left. The game will also keep track of how many games were won in a row. Keep in mind that this game was never originally designed to be very fun, it was meant to be an example to teach (very) basic <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> programming. These upcoming features are simply the result me giving into <a class="zem_slink" title="Peer pressure" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure">peer pressure</a> and trying to make the game more enjoyable. Keep in mind that this is an open source project and anyone is welcome to contribute code if they would like to see it in the game. The feature is done as far as coding, I just have to work on the new layout.</p>
