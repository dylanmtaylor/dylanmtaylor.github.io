  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

<p>It's about time I made <a title="Clippy Clipboard Manager" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;clippy&#47;">a page dedicated just to Clippy<&#47;a>, which, at this rate, is becoming a larger project every day. This page will be used to explain the purpose of Clippy, list it's features, and talk about useful tips and tricks that can make using Clippy a better experience. The page is still under construction, but I'm pretty happy with how it looks right now, and I'm planning on updating <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;clippy&#47;">the page<&#47;a> and adding new content as I continue to work on the Clippy project. Even though Clippy already has many useful features, and it can probably be useful on a daily basis, Clippy is still missing a lot of functions that will take it from "Pretty Good" to "Great". Because I'd probably forget to add features to the page later, I added some features that don't exist yet&#47;don't work right to the list of features on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;clippy&#47;">the Clippy page<&#47;a>. These features are marked in <span style="color:#ff0000;">red text<&#47;span>, so that you can easily identify them. If you have any feedback about the page, or any suggestions for content that you believe I should add to it, feel free to let me know.</p>
