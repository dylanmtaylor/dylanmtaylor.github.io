<p>It's about time I made <a title="Clippy Clipboard Manager" href="/clippy/">a page dedicated just to Clippy</a>, which, at this rate, is becoming a larger project every day. This page will be used to explain the purpose of Clippy, list it's features, and talk about useful tips and tricks that can make using Clippy a better experience. The page is still under construction, but I'm pretty happy with how it looks right now, and I'm planning on updating <a href="/clippy/">the page</a> and adding new content as I continue to work on the Clippy project. Even though Clippy already has many useful features, and it can probably be useful on a daily basis, Clippy is still missing a lot of functions that will take it from "Pretty Good" to "Great". Because I'd probably forget to add features to the page later, I added some features that don't exist yet/don't work right to the list of features on <a href="/clippy/">the Clippy page</a>. These features are marked in <span style="color:#ff0000;">red text</span>, so that you can easily identify them. If you have any feedback about the page, or any suggestions for content that you believe I should add to it, feel free to let me know.</p>
