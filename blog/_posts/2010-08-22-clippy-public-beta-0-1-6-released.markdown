<p>After a long night of coding, I finally released the final version of Clippy Public Beta 0.1.6. If you haven't seen the list of improvements made in this new version, check out <a href="/pages/blog/2010/08/21/clippy-public-beta-0-1-6-is-in-progress/">my previous post</a>. This new version is more stable than the previous version. Between the previous version and the version I just uploaded to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android Market</a>, I fixed many important bugs, introduced working find functionality, added more settings, and, overall, made Clippy more full of win and awesome than I ever thought possible. The new version is in the market, so for those of you who have a previous version, you will soon receive a new update notification. I'm really tired, since I was up all night working on coding Clippy, so I'm going to keep this post short. Let me know if you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions for  future releases by posting a comment on my blog, or sending me an email. Enjoy! :)</p>
