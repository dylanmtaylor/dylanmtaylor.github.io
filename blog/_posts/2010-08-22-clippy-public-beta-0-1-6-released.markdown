  content: 'Hi Max, the application is published in the market, and should be visible
    to all devices with at least Android 1.6 installed. The application is definitely
    published and visible. I just checked the market on my Samsung Epic 4G. If you
    still can''t find it, try either going to http:&#47;&#47;market.adroid.com&#47;details?id=com.dylantaylor.clippy_beta
    in your android browser or scanning this QR code with a barcode scanning application:

    Hi Dylan, thanks for your response. there is something strange.... if i go to http:&#47;&#47;market.android.com&#47;details?id=com.dylantaylor.clippy_beta i obtain a 404 error (there was a typo in the link of your reply).
    Also with the qr code i receive an 'item not found' error (the same i obtained using other qr code from androlib etc. etc).
    I'm new of the android world, so i can't do any assumption on the causes of this strange behaviour.
    anyway i've googled and i've read that could be some sort of country based restriction....

    Please could you bypass the problem publishing the .apk file somewhere on the net?
    many thanks :)

    ps. sorry for my bad english ;-)

    i found that some app on the market are locked for the wilfire.
    i read on an italian forum that is possible to install the locked apps using the appbrainb site, with two other apps AppBrain and "Fast Web Installer"

    i will give it a try and i will report the results :)
    anyway i think that a apk file should be useful :)

    available in "All Locations". There are no regional restrictions on the software
    at all. I'm honestly not sure why you were unable to install my application. If
    you find out, it would be great if you could let me know so I could try to fix
    it. Thanks! :) Also, your English is very good! ;)

  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

<p>After a long night of coding, I finally released the final version of Clippy Public Beta 0.1.6. If you haven't seen the list of improvements made in this new version, check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;21&#47;clippy-public-beta-0-1-6-is-in-progress&#47;">my previous post<&#47;a>. This new version is more stable than the previous version. Between the previous version and the version I just uploaded to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android Market<&#47;a>, I fixed many important bugs, introduced working find functionality, added more settings, and, overall, made Clippy more full of win and awesome than I ever thought possible. The new version is in the market, so for those of you who have a previous version, you will soon receive a new update notification. I'm really tired, since I was up all night working on coding Clippy, so I'm going to keep this post short. Let me know if you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions for  future releases by posting a comment on my blog, or sending me an email. Enjoy! :)</p>
