<p>I just spent almost 2 hours frantically trying to get the problems that were reported to me fixed, and I think I finally have it. I just released version 1.7 to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>, which should fix the force closes that some of you have been experiencing while attempting to remove the SMS sending limitation. If you are still having problems, feel free to send me an email. Otherwise, a 5 star rating would be nice. ;) I'd like to personally thank everybody who actually bothered emailing me about the problems and providing debugging information, instead of just leaving 1 star reviews and saying that you're having force closes, like some people did. Note: Leaving bad reviews does <strong>not</strong> actually fix it or provide any information that will help me fix it. Even if you state the device name, if I do not have the same device as you, I can't reproduce the bug on my end. For their help in fixing the issues, I'd especially like to thank Claude W., Mitchel R., and Timothy O. Without you, this bug fix wouldn't have been possible. If anyone continues to experience problems, or has issues/suggestions about the application, feel free to send me an email. Enjoy! :)</p>
