  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.2014PandaSeo.com\"

<p>Recently, I encountered <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dylanmtaylor.com&#47;?attachment_id=1041">an unusual graphics corruption bug in my lower<span class="zem_slink"><&#47;span> GNOME panel<&#47;a>. The panel still worked perfectly fine, but it was covered in unusual corruption artefacts, and it looked unsightly. I don't think many people will actually have this problem, but it was an incredibly simple and easy fix, so I decided to share it on my blog. This may also be useful if you manage to mess up your panel layout, and you just want to start from a fresh slate. The fix is simple: just delete the directory where your <a title="GNOME Panel" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;developer.gnome.org&#47;arch&#47;gnome&#47;corecomponents&#47;panel&#47;">GNOME panel<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Configuration file" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Configuration_file">configuration files<&#47;a> are stored, and <a class="zem_slink" title="GNOME" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gnome.org&#47;">GNOME<&#47;a> will automatically create a new configuration folder using the default settings the next time you login. The quickest way to do this (in my opinion) is through the terminal. Simply open up a terminal, and paste in the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p>rm -rfv $HOME&#47;.gconf&#47;apps&#47;panel<&#47;blockquote><br />
Now log out and log back in. Your GNOME panel settings will be reset to their defaults. Enjoy! :)</p>
