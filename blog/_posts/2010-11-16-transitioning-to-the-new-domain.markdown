<p>I'm currently manually porting over all of my posts from my old <a href="http://dylantaylor.wordpress.com/" rel="no-follow">WordPress.com sub-domain</a>. Until I'm done with that, all of my old content will still be on my old website. I'm not sure whether or not I will leave the content up, since I want to make visitors aware of my new site, but for now, I'm going to continue working on copying all of my old content over. Thank you for your patience. Also, if you would like to help me pay for the site, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/donate.cgi?id=13980">you can choose to do so here</a>.</p>
