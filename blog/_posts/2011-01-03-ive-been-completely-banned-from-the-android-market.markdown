<p>In case you were wondering where <em>all<&#47;em> of my <a class="zem_slink" title="Application software" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Application_software">applications<&#47;a> went, <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;google.com">Google<&#47;a> decided to suspend my entire account and all applications on it on December 29th, 2010 at 8:46 PM (<a class="zem_slink" title="Coordinated Universal Time" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC<&#47;a>). This is very disappointing, frustrating, and depressing, especially since I am no longer allowed to <a class="zem_slink" title="Uploading and downloading" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Uploading_and_downloading">upload<&#47;a> any new Android applications. I believe that Google went too far and should have only suspended the infringing applications instead of banning my entire account, since I had many legitimate, non-infringing applications on it, such as EliteGuard, <a class="zem_slink" title="Exchange rate" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Exchange_rate">Currency Converter<&#47;a>, Simple Dice, Find the Mouse, and InfiniteSMS (I don't believe simply removing the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS<&#47;a> sending limit qualifies as infringement). Here is the message I have received from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android Market<&#47;a> Support Team:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Dylan,</p>
<p>After a regular account review, your Android Market Publisher account has<br />
been suspended due to multiple violations of our <a class="zem_slink" title="Terms of service" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Terms_of_service">Terms of Service<&#47;a>. You may<br />
view these terms here:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;us&#47;developer-distribution-agreement.html" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;us&#47;developer-distribution-agreement.html<&#47;a> (Section<br />
4.4).<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;terms&#47;developer-content-policy.html" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;terms&#47;developer-content-policy.html<&#47;a></p>
<p>Please note that Android Market Publisher suspensions are associated with<br />
developers, and may span multiple accounts.</p>
<p>We are not inclined to reverse this decision.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
The Android Market Team<&#47;blockquote><br />
An hour after receiving this message from Google, I decided to try to appeal the ban, with an apology letter directed toward the Android Market team. As of January 3rd, 2011, I have not received any reply from them at all. A copy of my response to them is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Android Market Support,</p>
<p>In addition to the applications that  infringe upon your terms of service, I had many 'legitimate'  applications listed that cause no harm to any devices or networks, or  infringe on your terms of service in any way. I would like to appeal  your decision to suspend <a class="zem_slink" title="User (computing)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_%28computing%29">my account<&#47;a>, and I would like to request a  specific list of infringing applications and how they infringe upon your  terms of service so that I can remove those particular applications  from the market if I am given another chance to distribute my  applications on the Android market. Although you say that I have  multiple violations of your terms of service, the only application I  wrote that I am aware may potentially infringe on your terms of service  is "EliteBomb", my text-bombing application, of which I had multiple  versions listed. When I uploaded this application, I was not aware that  it was against your terms of service, and I would like to apologize for  any misunderstandings. I realize that you don't have to unsuspend my  developer account, but given another chance, I would like to keep my  applications that do not infringe on your terms of service listed, and  upload more applications in the future. I have no intention of abusing  the privilege of uploading Android applications. I will not upload  another text bombing application, given the chance, without your prior  consent.<br />

<span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately at this point, it doesn't look like I will be able to get my Android market developer account back, and this is really frustrating and depressing. I truly would like to continue to develop and support my applications for Android, but it does not look like Google will allow me the privilege of doing so, so I shall begin to look into alternative means of distribution. This is a truly disappointing and sorrowful moment for me. :-(<&#47;span><&#47;span></p>
