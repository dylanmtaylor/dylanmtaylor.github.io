  content: I cant believe that google suspended your entire account because of something
    like elite bomber.   What about all the other apps out there that spoof your number,
    etc?  Please keep us informed about other distribution options that you set up.  I
    looked here on your blog, but couldnt find any download links.  My friend just
    got a Droid and wanted elite bomb.  My friends and I use elite bomb on each other
    all the time.  If there is a way to download it, I would love to be able to get
    it for him so he can atleast get the rest of us back.

    visa cards and aliases and somehow Google knows, takes my $25 developer fee then
    closes the account an hour later with no reason. I have had reply to my appeals
    that said basically we won't reopen your account and we won't tell u why 4 separate
    developer accounts I had were closed. One account didn't even have any apps in
    it! \r\nI don't know if it's a temporary ban or for life? Somebody get a job at
    Google we need an inside man to help!"

    it's not done yet (you can tell it's a work in progress), and I have no way of
    accepting payments right now, as Google banned my Google Checkout account as well.
    Here are some direct links you can use for now, until I get the new site up:\r\n\r\nEliteBomb
    Regular Version (not Plus): http:&#47;&#47;code.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;apps&#47;android&#47;EliteBomber.apk\r\nEliteBomb
    Lite Version (for Android 1.6 ONLY): http:&#47;&#47;code.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;apps&#47;android&#47;EliteBomb-Lite.apk\r\nAndroid
    versions lower than 1.6 are not, and never have been supported.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the comment, it's great to see that one of my users actually bothered finding
    my blog and writing to me! It's very encouraging to know that there are people
    out there that actually care that I got banned from the Android market. :)"

  content: I understand your frustration, not from experience since I've never been
    there, but staring at the big corporate brick wall from the outside is always
    frustrating.  I also understand Google's perspective.  I wouldn't understand the
    finer technical points of how your app violated their terms of service even if
    it were explained, but I don't think that's the real issue here.  Since text messages
    cost some people money to receive, a text bombing app has the potential of causing
    significant financial injury.  I know that guns don't kill people and that people
    kill people, but a text bombing app doesn't pass the sniff test.  It's also pretty
    mean, even if you're in to pranking.  Forgive me if I sound patronizing, but I
    was a huge fan of clippy, and would love to see it added back to the marketplace.  I've
    had no luck in installing non market apps on my Dell Streak even using the SDK,
    so I guess I've got more reseatch to do.  But I'd love a link to clippy if you
    have it hosted somewhere.  I wish you luck in getting your publishing privileges
    back, especially since the requirements for reparations are not published.  But
    if you really have trouble making judgment calls on appropriate apps, have them
    reviewed before publishing by a few trusred sources first.  Seems you've had to
    pay a high price for your decision to publish first and ask for forgiveness later.

    you liked Clippy, and that you would like a link to it. Although I haven't tested
    this particular .apk file to make sure it works properly, here's a version of
    Clippy I found backed up on my hard drive: http:&#47;&#47;code.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;apps&#47;android&#47;Clippy.apk\r\nBecause
    I was working on improving Clippy, even though I have the source code, there are
    some bugs with the version I've been working on, so hopefully that link works
    right. If not, I'll have a working version up eventually. I've been somewhat busy
    lately..."

  content: Is Clippy open source?  I've never developed on an Android app before,
    and Clippy seems simple enough to not to be overwhelming.  If it has bugs, I wouldn't
    mind taking a look at it.  It may take me some time to get the dev tools setup,
    and I haven't had any luck sideloading my Dell Streak even using the Sideload
    Wonder Machine.  I've found some articles on rooting the Dell Streak, but haven't
    jumped yet.  Is the source for Clippy hosted somewhere, or is it closed source.  If
    it is closed, I wouldn't mind agreeing to an NDA to have a look at a practical
    and functional Android app like Clippy.  Let me know.

  content: Clippy is not open source software (yet). I was planning on open sourcing
    it, but I have a lot of other things I need to get done. Open sourcing it would
    require cleaning up the code, fixing some bugs, and documenting the source code,
    all of which are very tedious. I'll probably end up open sourcing it in the future.

    on tv shows and beer commercials.  They wouldn't tell me what images were against
    the policy and with 1000's of apps with stolen images still on the market I was
    disappointed.  My apps were well build, didn't hijack anyone's phone or spam sites
    to anyone.  I understand stopping those who steal content or applications that
    are adult (nude).  It is truly to bad that google does not have the desire to
    work with all of its developers or even communicate outside of a generic email.
    \ Android is taking over the mobile world and I don't want to be left behind.
    \r\n\r\nThat said for all of you who have been banned and have quality applications
    there are 3rd party stores but of course the eye balls on them is nothing vs.
    android market.  I put my apps on AdultAppMart.com I don't want to spam this blog
    as I think the information provided is very helpful to all of us but I did want

    me.\r\n\r\nI paid her for her service buy she refuses to do what I ask.\r\n\r\nShe
    doesn't return my phone calls and doesn't reply to my e-mail so I want to bomb

An hour after receiving this message from Google, I decided to try to appeal the ban, with an apology letter directed toward the Android Market team. As of January 3rd, 2011, I have not received any reply from them at all. A copy of my response to them is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Android Market Support,</p>
<p>In addition to the applications that  infringe upon your terms of service, I had many 'legitimate'  applications listed that cause no harm to any devices or networks, or  infringe on your terms of service in any way. I would like to appeal  your decision to suspend <a class="zem_slink" title="User (computing)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_%28computing%29">my account<&#47;a>, and I would like to request a  specific list of infringing applications and how they infringe upon your  terms of service so that I can remove those particular applications  from the market if I am given another chance to distribute my  applications on the Android market. Although you say that I have  multiple violations of your terms of service, the only application I  wrote that I am aware may potentially infringe on your terms of service  is "EliteBomb", my text-bombing application, of which I had multiple  versions listed. When I uploaded this application, I was not aware that  it was against your terms of service, and I would like to apologize for  any misunderstandings. I realize that you don't have to unsuspend my  developer account, but given another chance, I would like to keep my  applications that do not infringe on your terms of service listed, and  upload more applications in the future. I have no intention of abusing  the privilege of uploading Android applications. I will not upload  another text bombing application, given the chance, without your prior  consent.<br />

<span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;">Unfortunately at this point, it doesn't look like I will be able to get my Android market developer account back, and this is really frustrating and depressing. I truly would like to continue to develop and support my applications for Android, but it does not look like Google will allow me the privilege of doing so, so I shall begin to look into alternative means of distribution. This is a truly disappointing and sorrowful moment for me. :-(<&#47;span><&#47;span></p>
