  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.2014PandaSeo.com\"

    calories a day can be dangerous, when done consistently. This is science.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

<p>I just finished setting up a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pledgie.com&#47;">Pledgie<&#47;a> campaign in order to raise money to support the development of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;clippy&#47;">Clippy<&#47;a>, my <a class="zem_slink" title="Clipboard manager" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Clipboard_manager">clipboard manager<&#47;a> for <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android<&#47;a>. If you use Clippy, and find useful, please consider making a small donation. Clippy is currently a 100% free application, no strings attached, and in order to keep it that way, I need a way to make a little bit of money. Clippy is currently a one-man project, and I do all the work I do on it during my spare time. I have invested many hours into developing Clippy, and I'm hoping that some of that work will start to pay off soon. &Acirc;&nbsp;The more money that is donated to the Clippy project, the more time I'm able to invest in developing and supporting Clippy. Also, as an added incentive to encourage donations, if I receive over <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">$20,000<&#47;span> <strong>$1,000<&#47;strong> in donations, I will release the entire <span class="zem_slink"><a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Source_code">source code<&#47;a><&#47;span> for Clippy under version 3 of the <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU General Public License" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;GNU_General_Public_License">GNU<&#47;a> General Public License, and all of the resources, including the original <a class="zem_slink" title="Vector graphics" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Vector_graphics">vector graphic<&#47;a> files, under the <a class="zem_slink" title="Creative Commons licenses" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.creativecommons.org&#47;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported<&#47;a> License.&Acirc;&nbsp; In addition to that, I'll set up a repository on <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;">github<&#47;a> to encourage <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open development<&#47;a>, and allow others to contribute code. I got the inspiration for this idea from an independent gaming package called the "<a class="zem_slink" title="Humble Indie Bundle" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wolfire.com&#47;humble">Humble Indie Bundle<&#47;a>", where you could pay what you want for a package of 5 games. Basically, they offered to make their games <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open source<&#47;a> if they could raise <strong>$1 Million<&#47;strong>. Needless to say, they succeeded. So, in the spirit of the Humble Indie Bundle, I'm offering to make my application open source if I can raise<strong> $1,000<span style="font-weight: normal;">, which is practically pocket change compared to the goal they set, yet still a very substantial amount to me. If you don't feel like signing up for Pledgie, you can <&#47;span><&#47;strong><a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.paypal.com&#47;cgi-bin&#47;webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=8UWQHV6TZNPQ8">make a donation using traditional PayPal<&#47;a>, but I'd have to manually enter your donation into Pledgie for it to count towards the <strong>$1,000<&#47;strong><strong> <&#47;strong>goal.</p>
