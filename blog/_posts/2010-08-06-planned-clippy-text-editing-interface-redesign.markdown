<p>It's pretty apparent that the <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a> used for editing the current <a class="zem_slink" title="Clipboard (software)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_%28software%29">clipboard</a> text needs some major changes. Therefore, I'm busy working on redesigning the user interface right now, but I'll post some pictures of the new interface soon. Here's a few more details: the new interface won't always be at the bottom of the screen. It will appear when the menu button is pressed, allowing for more screen real estate dedicated to editing text, which is helpful on devices without a physical <span class="zem_slink">keyboard</span>.</p>
