<p>I've been pretty busy with other things lately, and I do all of my coding in my spare time. It's been a week since my last update, so I'm posting so you guys know that the Clippy project is not dead, but there is a lot of work to do before I can release it to the market with the new <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a>.
