  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoAnalyticNews.com\"

  content: "I have trouble stopping eating even if I am full. So, I find is more effective
    to count my calories and net carbs. I know myself, and if I didn't have to count
    calories I would eat double the appropriate portions, especially for beef or pork.
    I find it works pretty well for me to shoot for 1500ish calories on non-exercising
    days and 1700ish on weightlifting days. I'm not rigid about this but it is my
    guideline. I always try to stay under 30 net carbs. Unfortunately, without fail
    every 2-6 months I go crazy and gain all the weight back that I had lost. Maybe
    someday I will learn how to stick to it.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

    without having side-effects , people can take a signal. Will likely be back to
    get more. Thanks

    Additionally, the blog loads super fast for me on Chrome. Excellent Blog!

<p>I've been pretty busy with other things lately, and I do all of my coding in my spare time. It's been a week since my last update, so I'm posting so you guys know that the Clippy project is not dead, but there is a lot of work to do before I can release it to the market with the new <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_interface">user interface<&#47;a>. Sorry for the delays!</p>
