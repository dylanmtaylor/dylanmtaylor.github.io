<p>I've been pretty busy with other things lately, and I do all of my coding in my spare time. It's been a week since my last update, so I'm posting so you guys know that the Clippy project is not dead, but there is a lot of work to do before I can release it to the market with the new <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_interface">user interface<&#47;a>. Sorry for the delays!</p>
