<p>I have been getting <strong><em>tons</em></strong> of messages asking me to fix the force close issues when trying to remove the limit of <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS messages</a> to be sent. These messages are so far only appearing <strong>exclusively on <a class="zem_slink" title="HTC" rel="homepage" href="http://www.htc.com">HTC</a> devices</strong>... because I do not have an HTC device, I have no way of knowing what the problem is, and it may be a while before I can get a proper fix out. Therefore, if you <em>do</em> have an HTC device, it would be great if you could help me fix this problem. I really do want to get this working for as many devices as possible. If you are experiencing issues on a non-HTC device, please send me an email with information about your device. Here is the count of crash reports so far:</p>
<p><strong>HTC <a class="zem_slink" title="HTC Evo 4G" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Evo_4G">Evo 4G</a>: </strong>3 Reports<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>HTC Droid Eris: </strong>1 Report</p>
<p><strong>HTC Magic:</strong> 1 Report</p>
<p><strong>Unknown Device:</strong> 2 Reports</p>
<p>I really do want to get this fixed <em>as soon as possible</em>. If you are having issues, leaving a low rating and a comment on the market <em>does not help me fix the problem.</em> If you really want to help, send me an email with as much information as possible, and I'll do whatever I can to make it work for you. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
