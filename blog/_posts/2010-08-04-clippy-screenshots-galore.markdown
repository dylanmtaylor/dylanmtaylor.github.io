<p>Just as I promised, here are some screenshots of Clippy as it is in its current state. There is currently a non-obtrusive advertisement on the "About" tab, but I don't think that will detract from the experience of using Clippy at all. I have 10 screenshots of Clippy, but if you want to try it out for yourself, the public beta is available for free in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android Market</a>. Anyways, here you go:</p>
