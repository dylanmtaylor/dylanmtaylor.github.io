<p>I finished making the changes to "Find The Mouse", and the new code is up on github. I'm already in the process of signing and uploading the new version to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>. You should be able to download it very soon! The new version automatically advances to the next level after you successfully find the mouse, it keeps track of your winning streak and current score, and the <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">user interface</a> feels much nicer. Enjoy! :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The new version is now up on the market! Check it out!</p>
