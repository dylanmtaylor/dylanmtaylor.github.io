  content: Yeah, I got a letter like that too.  I smell a scam, but I could be wrong.  Honestly,
    I'm really nervous about distributing it to a country where my copyrights aren't
    enforcible at all.

    far from reassuring. I believe that they are sending emails to (almost) any developer
    who lists their email address.

    I don't think this sounds like someone who want to steal your application and pretend to be their own and sell it. Please search "adam gates". People who want to may copies will do things like him, just download your application and change the content inside it to make it "his own" software.

    Besides, I found there is less than 10 download from Korea, out of my 10,000 download, I think Korea market is somewhere that invisible by android market users, or Korea already blocked access to android market. If that is the case, going through this kind of deal may be a good choice to get some money out of a market that I cannot reach by myself.

    I am still undergoing negotiation with them, and I will keep you guys posted whether or not I can receive the down payment.  Cheers !

  content: "Here's my contribution to the growing mystery;  1)We need to look for
    any patterns that might exist in regards to who is being contacted by Ubinuri.
    2)We need to be wary not just of financial scams but of any kind of espionage
    that might be carried out without our knowledge. 3)Something doesn't \"smell\"
    \ right about this and I don't think its about money.\r\n\r\nHere's the e-mail
    I received in its entirety:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear David Stopar,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI
    am writing on behalf of Ubinuri, Inc., a distributor of Android-based mobile applications
    through local app stores in Korea. I am writing to express our interest in selling
    your application, My Moral Compass, in Korea. \r\n\r\nAs Game category of Android
    Market is not available in Korea, your game applications cannot be purchased by
    any of 2 million Korean android phone users at Android Market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn
    addition, in order to sell your application at the local app stores in Korea,
    it is necessary to implement, within your application, the Application Rights
    Management (ARM) software provided by the local app store vendors. Ubinuri is
    willing to compensate you in advance for your efforts to implement the ARM software.\r\n\r\n
    \ \r\n\r\nIn this regard, I would appreciate it greatly if you would review the
    following proposal:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1) Implementation of ARM Software\r\n\r\n
    \r\n\r\n- In order to sell apps through Korean app stores, developers must implement
    ARM plug-ins within their apps. The ARM plug-ins prevent illegal copying of the
    protected applications and ensure that applications purchased from the app stores
    are genuine.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Ubinuri will pay 300 US Dollars per application
    for the implementation of the ARM software vended by the largest app store in
    Korea.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- It is our hope that this fee will provide adequate compensation
    to the application developer for the work required to implement the ARM plug-in
    within their application.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- In addition, Ubinuri will apply for
    and obtain game rating from Korea Game Rating Board for and on behalf of you at
    its own cost. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) Payment\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- In adition to the
    above mentioned fee for implementing the ARM software, Ubinuri is prepared to
    pay 50% of the net revenue generated by sales of each application sold on the
    Korean app store. \r\n\r\n(The operator of the Korean app store will take 30%
    of the net revenue generated by sales of your application, and Ubinuri will take
    20%. In exchange for the 20% of revenue, Ubinuri will provide Korean language
    localization, marketing, financial reporting, customer care, and settlement&#47;remittance
    of funds to you, as well as other services as needed.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- When
    your applications are sold on Ubinuri&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own App Store, which
    will launch in early 2011, Ubinuri will pay you 70% of the net revenue generated
    by sales of your applications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are interested
    in learning more about this opportunity, or have any questions, please feel free
    to contact me.\r\n\r\n(For further information, please visit www.ubi-nuri.com)\r\n\r\n
    \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nScott\r\n\r\nUbinuri,
    Inc.\r\n\r\nwww.ubi-nuri.com\r\n\r\n907 E&amp;C Venture Dream Tower 6\r\n\r\n197-28

  content: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nmaybe it's a bit late, but I wanted to leave my impressions
    about working with this Korean distributor, UbiNuri.\r\n\r\nI came here (and every
    other site around) asking the same questions everyone had, back in 2010. I felt
    this to be \"too good to be true\" too, but since we had nothing to lose (ours
    is a simple, free game app - well, we made a non-free version for UbiNuri removing
    the ads).\r\n\r\nThe result: these guys are really nice and trustworthy, communication
    has never been a problem. There's always the lost in translation factor, but we
    talked over mail, google talk, Skype, and they have been responsive, understanding
    and kind. They even went all the way as to send thrice the whole quantity ($300)
    since we had problems with our bank that rejected the transfer twice, and UbiNuri
    assumed the transfer costs for the failed transfers.\r\n\r\nNow we received the
    payment, and we're waiting four our app to be published in the T-Store via UbiNuri,
    only because another market that had our app (Handster) had it published in the
    T-Store first (sigh).\r\nSo, what I want to tell you, it's that you can really
    trust UbiNuri. All the problems and delays we suffered weren't due to UbiNuri
    but to our (previous) bank, Handster publishing in the T-Store without our consent,
    etc. \r\n\r\nI cannot tell you if sales will be worth the effort since we're not
    selling yet, but I'd say the ARM implementation was pretty straightforward and
    took only two days because we made some mistakes, but one of their engineers helped
    us out (even recorded a video for us to see the errors).\r\n\r\nWe'll work with
    them again if given the chance... the least I could do was to clear out any doubts
    about UbiNuri. If anyone wants to get in touch for more info, with my nick and
    my url you can get my email =)"

<p>If you didn't know already, I'm a <em>huge<&#47;em> advocate of the <a title="Free Software Foundation" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fsf.org&#47;">Free Software Foundation<&#47;a> and their <a title="Free Software Foundation Campaigns" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fsf.org&#47;campaigns&#47;">campaigns<&#47;a>, including <a href="http:&#47;&#47;playogg.org&#47;">PlayOgg<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;windows7sins.org&#47;">Windows 7 Sins<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;endsoftpatents.org&#47;">End Software Patents<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;defectivebydesign.org&#47;">DefectiveByDesign.org<&#47;a>, etc., so, naturally, I dislike <a class="zem_slink" title="Digital rights management" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Digital_rights_management">DRM<&#47;a> in any form, and I use, develop, and promote <a title="free and open source software on Wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Free_and_open_source_software">free and open source software<&#47;a>. However, I just received an offer from a <a class="zem_slink" title="South Korea" rel="geolocation" href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?ll=37.5833333333,127.0&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=37.5833333333,127.0%20%28South%20Korea%29&amp;t=h">South Korean<&#47;a> company called "Ubinuri, Inc.", offering to pay me $300 to "implement ARM (Application Digital Right Management) plugin to your application" and allow them to sell my application, "FiOS WEP Calculator PRO" to the Korean market. In addition to that they say they'll pay me between 50-70% of the revenue they make from selling my application. Although I don't like the idea of having DRM in my application, all of my applications in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a> are still 100% DRM-free, and they will stay that way. I don't believe in putting crippling <a class="zem_slink" title="Computer software" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Computer_software">software<&#47;a> in my applications. I have contacted Ubinuri requesting more information, and I am considering going through with the deal, as $300 is a lot of money, and it's hard to pass up an offer like this. Here are some of the questions I asked them (ad verbatim):</p>
<ul>
<li>How will I receive the payment for implementing the ARM and allowing you to sell it?<&#47;li>
<li>How often will I receive payments for the revenue you earn by selling my application?<&#47;li>
<li>What does implementing ARM involve, and how can I do that?<&#47;li>
<li>Will I still be able to sell my application in the Android marketplace, in addition to your store?<&#47;li>
<li>Will  I receive the $300 payment prior to sending you my application, or do I  just have to trust you that I will receive my payment?<&#47;li>
<li>Does Ubinuri, Inc. have a <a class="zem_slink" title="United States" rel="geolocation" href="http:&#47;&#47;maps.google.com&#47;maps?ll=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667%20%28United%20States%29&amp;t=h">United States<&#47;a> presence&#47;division?<&#47;li>
<li>I would like a legally binding licensing agreement in order to make sure that I don't get scammed.<&#47;li>
<li>Can I send you the application as it is, or do you require Korean language translation to be done at my expense?<&#47;li>
<li>Will translations be provided?<&#47;li>
<li>Would you mind providing me the names of some of your app store operators?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I will let you guys know whether or not I decide to go through with the deal, and I will also update this post or make a new one when they reply to my e-mail. I'm somewhat skeptical about their offer, and several people tend to agree with me, but it is a really great offer, and if it is legitimate, I would be glad to take advantage of it. I have heard several other developers saying that they got the letter as well, but I have not been able to find a single developer claiming that they took advantage of the offer, and I have no plans of getting ripped off. Hopefully I will manage to negotiate an acceptable deal and actually receive a payment for my application. After all, I haven't made very much money from my application, and if I do receive $300, that will fund a large portion of my application development.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong> Here is a copy of the original e-mail message sent to me (the subject was "<em>Request  for &acirc;&euro;&oelig;FiOS WEP Calculator PRO&acirc;&euro;&oelig; Distribution in Korea<&#47;em>"):</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I work at Ubinuri, inc. which distributes android applications through local app stores in Korea.</p>
<p>I would like to propose you to sell "FiOS WEP Calculator PRO" in Korea.</p>
<p>In  order to sell your application at the local app stores in Korea, you  are requested to implement ARM (Application Digital Right Management)  plugin to your application, which would cause you additional efforts. In  this regard, Ubinuri is willing to compensate you in advance for your  additional efforts to implement the ARM.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could review following proposal and let me know your thought.</p>
<p>1) Implementation of ARM (Application Digital Right Management) - In order to sell apps through Korean app stores, developers are  requested to implement ARM, to prevent illegal copy, specified by the  operator of each app store.<br />
- You may hesitate to implement ARM as it would take you a couple of hours to implement ARM on your application.<br />
- So, Ubinuri would pay 300 USD per each application for implementing ARM of the biggest local app store in Korea.<br />
-&Acirc;&nbsp;  We hope our compensation would encourage you to implement ARM so that  Korean users could purchase your applications at Korean App Store.</p>
<p>2) Payment</p>
<p>In addition to the above initial payment,  Ubinuri shall pay 50% of the Net revenue for the sales of the above  applications at the above Korean app store.<br />
(The operator of the  Korean app stores will take 30% of the net revenue on your paid  applications. Ubinuri will take 20% of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Revenue" rel="wikinvest" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wikinvest.com&#47;metric&#47;Revenue">sales revenue<&#47;a> in return for  our investment for the above compensation and various activities for  localization, marketing, report, customer care, settlement&#47;remittance,  and others.</p>
<p>*In case of sales at Ubinuri's own App Store, which will be  launched in early 2011, Ubinuri will send you 70% of the net revenue.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the above proposal, I will send the detailed information on ARM.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Scott Jeon<br />

I haven't been able to find out much information about "Ubinuri, Inc.", but I did find references to several other messages sent to other application developers, such as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kmansoft.wordpress.com&#47;about&#47;#comment-17">this one from "Paul Noh"<&#47;a> to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kmansoft.wordpress.com&#47;">Kostya Vasilyev<&#47;a>, the developer of "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;uk.androlib.com&#47;android.application.org-kman-bluetoothwidget-Dzzm.aspx">Bluetooth widget<&#47;a>", and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;journal.zenyee.com&#47;about-zen&#47;#comment-1154">this other comment that's also from "Paul Noh"<&#47;a> to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;journal.zenyee.com&#47;">Zenyee<&#47;a>, the developer of "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;forum.xda-developers.com&#47;showthread.php?p=3050329#post3050329">Zenyee Rotate Screen<&#47;a>".</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2: <&#47;strong>I found a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.septillionsoft.com&#47;?p=260">brief blog post<&#47;a> by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.septillionsoft.com&#47;">Septillionsoft<&#47;a>, that says their application "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.septillionsoft.com&#47;?page_id=66">Fuel<&#47;a>" now supports the Korean language, and that the translation was done by "Ubinuri, Inc.".&Acirc;&nbsp; Although, it's still incredibly difficult to find any information about Ubinuri. In fact, it's so bad, that this post is already on the second page of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;search?client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs&amp;q=ubinuri%2C+inc&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">the Google search results for "Ubinuri, Inc."<&#47;a>, within hours of me initially posting this.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 3: <&#47;strong>I managed to locate yet another developer, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thetekblog.com&#47;">Tom Keeber<&#47;a>, who <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thetekblog.com&#47;?p=163">received a letter from Ubinuri<&#47;a> (this letter was also from Scott Jeon, the same person who wrote to me), asking them to allow them to distribute their application "Hydromaster". Also, on Tom's blog, a developer who <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thetekblog.com&#47;?p=163#comment-127">simply goes by "James" in his comment<&#47;a>, but has a website called "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aisops.com&#47;">AISOPS<&#47;a>" wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I received the same email. I have had several conversations with Scott  via email. I sent him my strings.xml to convert to Korean and received  it back. I have implemented the ARM code and am ready to send him the  apk but am a bit skeptical as well. I am going to ask for some  references before I send the file.<&#47;blockquote><br />
And, as another commenter, "Warren" pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ve also been contacted by Scott about my Android.  They offer the $300 provided I install the ARM and agree with their terms.</p>
<p>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m unclear on whether this is valid or not.  But I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m thinking that I  could generate a special version of the code just for them.  And if I  get something out of this, then good.</p>
<p>But, under no circumstances, will I provide bank account information.   I feel much more comfortable with the Android marketplace business  model.<&#47;blockquote><br />
I will continue to look into Ubinuri, and post my findings here, to make it easier for others who get similar e-mail messages find out more information about "Ubinuri, Inc.", and determine whether or not the offer is a scam. The fact that other developers have had direct communications with the company is reassuring, but I'm still somewhat uncomfortable about the lack of information about the company.</p>
