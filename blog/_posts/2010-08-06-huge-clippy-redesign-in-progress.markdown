  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizationTipz.com\"

<p>I've been working non-stop on redesigning the Clippy interface, and it's coming out very nice. However, in order to take full advantage of the service I'm implementing, I need to make some major fundamental changes of how Clippy works, in particular, how it accesses the <a title="Android ClipboardManager" href="http:&#47;&#47;developer.android.com&#47;reference&#47;android&#47;text&#47;ClipboardManager.html">ClipboardManager<&#47;a>, and how it reads from and writes to the clippings database. I'm planning on starting the service as soon as the application is opened, and having these basic tasks handled by the service, rather than having redundant code in each of my classes. Here's how this is going to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>The service will always run while Clippy is open, even if monitoring the <a class="zem_slink" title="Clipboard (software)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Clipboard_%28software%29">clipboard<&#47;a> is disabled.<&#47;li>
<li>While the Clippy interface is open, and in focus the service will not monitor the clipboard even if that feature is enabled.<&#47;li>
<li>If clipboard monitoring is disabled, the service will close when Clippy is exited. Otherwise, when Clippy is closed, the service will start monitoring the clipboard<&#47;li>
<li>The service will handle every single request for Clippy to read from or write to the clipboard or the database<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Also, I've been busier than usual lately, so expect there to be a bit of a delay between Clippy releases. Hopefully, I can get a version with the new, much better looking interface in the market soon.</p>
