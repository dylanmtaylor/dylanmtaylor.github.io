  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,

<p>I've been working on the next iteration of the Clippy project, Clippy Public Beta 0.1.6. In this release, I have made several <em>major<&#47;em> changes already, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All reading&#47;writing to the database is now handled by the Clippy Service<&#47;li>
<li>Adding a notification bar icon, as well as a notification that allows you to easily get back into Clippy from the notification bar<&#47;li>
<li>Created a custom notification layout for usage in the notification bar<&#47;li>
<li>Fixing a major bug where rotating the screen would restart the Clippy Service (only noticeable in verbose mode)<&#47;li>
<li>Moving most <a class="zem_slink" title="Hard coding" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Hard_coding">hard-coded<&#47;a> strings into a string resource file to allow for easier localization<&#47;li>
<li>Adding several additional log messages<&#47;li>
<li>Implementing an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;developer.android.com&#47;guide&#47;developing&#47;tools&#47;aidl.html">AIDL interface<&#47;a> to allow other classes to interact with the service<&#47;li>
<li>Added several more preferences in the settings menu<&#47;li>
<li>Added debugging tools, including the ability to replace all of your clippings with sample content copied from <a class="zem_slink" title="Wikipedia" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>Completely recreated the "About" tab layout from scratch, using <em>much<&#47;em> better written code<&#47;li>
<li>Enabled the "testing mode" for <a class="zem_slink" title="AdMob" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.admob.com">AdMob<&#47;a> ads when the application is running in the emulator<&#47;li>
<li>The find functionality now works perfectly, and the background of the interface for find is now transparent instead of being solid black<&#47;li>
<li>The "Search" button now opens&#47;closes the find bar for easy access to the find functionality<&#47;li>
<li>Added a preference to the Settings screen that allows you to choose whether or not the find function is case sensitive (by default, the find function does not pay attention to case)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
And several other, less noteworthy improvements. I am planning on releasing this new version to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android Market<&#47;a> soon.</p>
