<p><a href="http://www.dylanmtaylor.com/?attachment_id=893"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-893 alignleft" title="ShareThis Logo" src="/images/blog/2010/11/2000px-Sharethis.svg_-150x150.png" alt="" width="90" height="90" /></a>I've added a new feature to all posts on my site called "ShareThis". You can now choose to share posts with friends on <em>tons</em> of different social networks and blogs, including Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Blogger, and Google Buzz. You've probably seen these buttons on, like, every single blog ever written already, and I'm proud to announce that they're now on my site as well. To try it now, simply click one of the share icons at the bottom of this post. I'm hoping that these share buttons will bring even more visitors to my site. Not only that, but these buttons are also a really fun feature that lets you share posts that you find interesting with your friends. Check it out! The default selection of networks listed under the posts is subject to change, as I may add or remove preset networks based on recommendations from visitors, as well as my own intuition.</p>
