<p>I just finished adding links at the top of all of my posts on my old blog that point to the this site. Hopefully people and <a class="zem_slink" title="Web search engine" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Web_search_engine">search engines<&#47;a> will see these and realize that the site has moved to a new domain. Adding those links was very tedious, but overall, I think it was worth it, as it gives this site a lot more visibility.</p>
<div class="zemanta-pixie" style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: medium none; float: right;" src="http:&#47;&#47;dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;12&#47;pixy4.gif" alt="" &#47;><&#47;div></p>
