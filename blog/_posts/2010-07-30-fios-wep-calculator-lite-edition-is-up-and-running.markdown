The application is called "<em><a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Verizon_FiOS">FiOS<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP<&#47;a> Calc Lite<&#47;em>" in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android Market<&#47;a>. I had a "PRO" version up for a few hours that I was planning on keeping free for a limited time (letting anyone who downloaded it while it was free keep it forever), but unfortunately you can't change it to make it paid later (for those who download it after I change the price), so I pulled that until I get my account set-up to accept payments. The minimum possible price for an application in the Android Market is<strong> $0.99<&#47;strong>, so that's the price it will cost. I'm not doing this just for the money, so if you download the "Lite" version, please rate the application, and write a review. I know that one developer, Kismet Iheke, is selling a similar application on the market for<strong> $1.99<&#47;strong>, and they have between 500 and 1000 downloads so far, so yes, I do realize that I'm losing money, since I only get paid anything at all if people click my advertisements, and even so, <a class="zem_slink" title="PayPal" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;paypal.com">PayPal<&#47;a> takes <strong>$0.30<&#47;strong> plus like<strong> 2.9%<&#47;strong> out of my revenue, but hey, it's better than nothing. And besides, I don't really want to charge for my application. I want to make it free to as many people as possible. Anyways, here's a few screenshots:</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>
<p><strong>P.S. <&#47;strong>If you notice that you are unable to enter special characters in the text field, that's a feature, not a bug. In addition to that, all lowercase letters are automatically converted to their uppercase equivalents, since all FiOS network names are all caps, using only <a class="zem_slink" title="Alphanumeric" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Alphanumeric">alphanumeric<&#47;a> characters, and the text box has a maximum limit of 5 characters. It is not possible to calculate a WEP key for an access point that changed its ESSID from the default. Also, both the lite version and the pro version of this software have absolutely no <a class="zem_slink" title="Copy protection" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Copy_protection">copy protection<&#47;a> what-so-ever. People who pirate my application will find a way around the copy protection, and I doubt very many people would pirate something when an advertisement supported version is available for free.</p>
<p><strong>P.P.S. <&#47;strong>If you long press on one of the bottom boxes, you can copy the text to the clipboard... 'nuff said. ;)</p>
