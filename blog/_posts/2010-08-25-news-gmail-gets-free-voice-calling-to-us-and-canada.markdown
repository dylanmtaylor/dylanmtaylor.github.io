    Lorelie Lee in an envelope from you. We have no idea whatsoever how I got on your

  content: "Our diet should ideally consist of 50 produce, 25 grains&#47;legumes,
    and 25 protein sources. Another way of assessing nutrients: 45-65 carbohydrate,
    10-35 protein, and 20-30 fat. For the average person, consuming less than 1200
    calories a day can be dangerous, when done consistently. This is science.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

  content: Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea shell and
    gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said "You can hear the ocean if you put
    this to your ear." She placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit
    crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this
    is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!

<p><&#47;div><br />
<a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;google.com">Google<&#47;a> just added a really cool feature to their already great <a class="zem_slink" title="Gmail" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;gmail.com">Gmail<&#47;a> service... <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gmailblog.blogspot.com&#47;2010&#47;08&#47;call-phones-from-gmail.html">free voice calling<&#47;a>. It is now possible to simple click a link (labeled "Call phone"), type in a <a class="zem_slink" title="Telephone number" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Telephone_number">phone number<&#47;a>, and dial it, using your computer's speakers and microphone. The only downside is that you have to install <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;chat&#47;voice&#47;">a proprietary plugin<&#47;a>, which is available for <a class="zem_slink" title="Windows" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;WINDOWS">Microsoft Windows<&#47;a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Mac OS X" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;macosx&#47;">Mac OS X<&#47;a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Linux" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Linux">Linux<&#47;a>. I tested the service on my computer running <a class="zem_slink" title="Ubuntu (operating system)" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntu.com&#47;">Ubuntu Linux<&#47;a> 10.10 (<a class="zem_slink" title="List of Ubuntu releases" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;List_of_Ubuntu_releases">Maverick Meerkat<&#47;a>) <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntu.com&#47;testing&#47;maverick&#47;alpha3">Alpha 3<&#47;a> (64-bit edition). The call quality is excellent, and it rivals other competing <a class="zem_slink" title="Voice over IP" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Voice_over_IP">VoIP<&#47;a> solutions such as <a class="zem_slink" title="Skype" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;skype.com">Skype<&#47;a>, not to mention, it costs <em>absolutely nothing<&#47;em>, as long as you are dialing a number located in the <a class="zem_slink" title="United States" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;United_States">United States<&#47;a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Canada" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Canada">Canada<&#47;a>. This is a really great addition to Gmail, and I hope to see Google add the ability to dial numbers from their Google Voice service too. Another thing that I'd <em>really<&#47;em> love to see as well is the ability to dial phone numbers using your Google Voice number from the Google Voice application for Android and other <a class="zem_slink" title="Mobile phone" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Mobile_phone">mobile phone<&#47;a> platforms. Also, if you are calling number outside of the United States or Canada, you can also make international calls at competitive rates. Check it out!</p>
