<p>I don't think this matters to many of you, but I'm excited to announce that I just finished completely revamping the <a class="zem_slink" title="AdMob" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.admob.com">AdMob<&#47;a> advertisements for my EliteBomb application. If you've ever seen my old EliteBomb ads, you may remember them as being boring, plain-text advertisements. Well, that's all about to change, as I just finished creating some new, awesome looking EliteBomb ads, for both the free version of EliteBomb, and the EliteBomb Plus. I already stopped running the old advertisements, and the new advertisements are already running as I'm writing this post. The EliteBomb advertisement will be running in all of my applications, except for EliteBomb itself, and the EliteBomb Plus advertisement will be running in the free version of EliteBomb. Look out for these ads:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;market.android.com&#47;details?id=com.dylantaylor.elitebomb"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-682" title="EliteBomb Advertisement" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;eb-promo.png" alt="" width="320" height="48" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;market.android.com&#47;details?id=com.dylantaylor.elitebomb_plus"><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-683 alignnone" title="EliteBomb Plus Advertisement" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;plus-ad-extreme-dark.png" alt="" width="320" height="48" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
