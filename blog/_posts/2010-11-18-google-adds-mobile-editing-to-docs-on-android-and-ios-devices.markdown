<p>This post is somewhat out of the ordinary, but this is just so cool, I couldn't help myself from sharing it. Google just released <a href="http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/11/create-and-edit-your-google-docs-on-the.html">a new feature in Google Docs</a> that will let you edit your documents from any mobile phone running Android or iOS. Not only that, but you can also edit your document while others are editing it at the same time, with "near real-time" updates. This new feature will be available for all users on Android version 2.2 or iOS version 3.0 or greater. Users on Android can also write text using their voice. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAr5VoYdVBo&amp;hd=1">the following video</a>, it's pretty cool.</p>
