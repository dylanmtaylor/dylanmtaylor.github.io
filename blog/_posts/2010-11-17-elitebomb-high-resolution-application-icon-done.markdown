<p>I just finished working on the new mandatory <a class="zem_slink" title="Image resolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution">high resolution</a> application <a class="zem_slink" title="Icon" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon">icon</a> for the free version of EliteBomb. It's a real shame that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a> <a title="Android Market Compressed Version" href=/pages/blog/2010/11/17/elitebomb-high-resolution-application-icon-done/pqaaaauvuniz9af5xelevflog3ibpcspp8mfjxm1i2x_lggdfnn7co_9zj1qjwojjzkgbxakdldqor_zttjjikhpog0azfqvaxo2g3ou7leb2_hfjurz96egz3du/">compresses the images that you see on your mobile devices so much</a>. In fact, because of the ridiculous compression, having a high resolution icon is somewhat pointless. I'm speculating that these high resolution icons will be used in a future Android product, most likely a tablet, as 512 x 512 images are much too large to be used on a phone. Anyways, I think the icon came out pretty well, but, as with all artwork, you can always judge that for yourself (click the image for full size):</p>
