  content: "I do want to add that sometimes emotional eating can sabotage someone's
    commitment to this way of eating, because occasionally the emotions that can trigger
    a carb binge are far more powerful than the urge to eat well and lose weight;
    tackling these emotions helps tremendously.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

<p>I just finished working on the new mandatory <a class="zem_slink" title="Image resolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Image_resolution">high resolution<&#47;a> application <a class="zem_slink" title="Icon" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Icon">icon<&#47;a> for the free version of EliteBomb. It's a real shame that the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a> <a title="Android Market Compressed Version" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;17&#47;elitebomb-high-resolution-application-icon-done&#47;pqaaaauvuniz9af5xelevflog3ibpcspp8mfjxm1i2x_lggdfnn7co_9zj1qjwojjzkgbxakdldqor_zttjjikhpog0azfqvaxo2g3ou7leb2_hfjurz96egz3du&#47;">compresses the images that you see on your mobile devices so much<&#47;a>. In fact, because of the ridiculous compression, having a high resolution icon is somewhat pointless. I'm speculating that these high resolution icons will be used in a future Android product, most likely a tablet, as 512 x 512 images are much too large to be used on a phone. Anyways, I think the icon came out pretty well, but, as with all artwork, you can always judge that for yourself (click the image for full size):</p>
