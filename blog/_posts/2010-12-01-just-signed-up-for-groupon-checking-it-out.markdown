<p>So, <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu12840009">Groupon</a> is the latest thing that everyone has been talking about lately. Basically, there is a new, localized deal every day on <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu12840009">Groupon</a>, which gives a huge discount on certain <a class="zem_slink" title="Goods and services" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services">goods and services</a>. The deal doesn't start until a certain number of people say that they agree to buy it. This is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Win-win game" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game">win-win</a> situation for both consumers and sellers of goods, as the buyers get a great deal, while the sellers/retailers get a guaranteed minimum number of customers. I personally haven't found anything worthwhile on <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu12840009">Groupon</a> yet, but since it's been the subject of tons of media attention lately, I decided to create a free account and take a look around. Although I'm new to the site myself, I recommend <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu12840009">signing up</a> and judging it for yourself. If you're interested in checking it out, <a href="http://www.groupon.com/r/uu12840009">click here</a>.</p>
