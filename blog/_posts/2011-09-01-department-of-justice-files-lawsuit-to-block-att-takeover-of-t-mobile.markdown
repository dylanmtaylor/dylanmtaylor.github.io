<p>In case you didn't hear, <a class="zem_slink" title="AT&amp;T" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.att.com" rel="homepage">AT&amp;T<&#47;a> is in the process of attempting to acquire <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.t-mobile.com&#47;">T-Mobile<&#47;a> for $39 billion. Not only would this make AT&amp;T the nation's largest wireless carrier (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.notakeover.org&#47;sites&#47;all&#47;themes&#47;sprint&#47;images&#47;slideshow&#47;slides&#47;reduces-competition.pdf">controlling 43.3% of the wireless market<&#47;a>), but it would also mean that <em>more than<&#47;em><em> 75%<&#47;em> of the nation's wireless customers would be on AT&amp;T and <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon Wireless" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.verizonwireless.com" rel="homepage">Verizon Wireless<&#47;a>. What this means is that the third largest carrier, <a class="zem_slink" title="Sprint Nextel" href="http:&#47;&#47;sprint.com&#47;" rel="homepage">Sprint<&#47;a>, which I'm a customer of, would have less than a fourth of the nation's wireless customers. This deal is extremely anti-competitive, and anti-consumer. With less carriers, and less choice, this would allow cellular providers to increase prices, decrease choices in phones, and reduce innovation. Just yesterday, the <a class="zem_slink" title="United States Department of Justice" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.justice.gov" rel="homepage">Justice Department<&#47;a>&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.justice.gov&#47;opa&#47;pr&#47;2011&#47;August&#47;11-at-1118.html">filed a lawsuit to block the proposed deal.<&#47;a> I strongly believe that there would be no benefits to consumers from this acquisition. All AT&amp;T is doing is eliminating a major competitor. If you're on T-Mobile, you probably realize that you have access to some of the cheapest prices available in the wireless industry, as well as decent coverage. If AT&amp;T acquires T-Mobile, it's fairly obvious that they will change the pricing scheme to match that of their own, allowing them to force consumers into paying a lot more for their wireless service. Service charges are <em>already<&#47;em> high as it is, with more carriers charging more money for lesser or equal amounts of features and unlimited data service disappearing in favor of a tiered pricing model, we simply can't afford to lose a huge competitor to the major cellular carriers. I believe that everyone who owns a cellular phone in America will be, in some way, hurt by this deal.&Acirc;&nbsp;As consumers, we simply cannot allow AT&amp;T to acquire T-Mobile. The only possible outcome is less competition, less choice in wireless devices, higher prices, and less jobs in the wireless industry.</p>
