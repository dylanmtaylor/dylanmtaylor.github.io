<p>In case you didn't hear, <a class="zem_slink" title="AT&amp;T" href="http://www.att.com" rel="homepage">AT&amp;T</a> is in the process of attempting to acquire <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> for $39 billion. Not only would this make AT&amp;T the nation's largest wireless carrier (<a href="http://www.notakeover.org/sites/all/themes/sprint/images/slideshow/slides/reduces-competition.pdf">controlling 43.3% of the wireless market</a>), but it would also mean that <em>more than</em><em> 75%</em> of the nation's wireless customers would be on AT&amp;T and <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon Wireless" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com" rel="homepage">Verizon Wireless</a>. What this means is that the third largest carrier, <a class="zem_slink" title="Sprint Nextel" href="http://sprint.com/" rel="homepage">Sprint</a>, which I'm a customer of, would have less than a fourth of the nation's wireless customers. This deal is extremely anti-competitive, and anti-consumer. With less carriers, and less choice, this would allow cellular providers to increase prices, decrease choices in phones, and reduce innovation. Just yesterday, the <a class="zem_slink" title="United States Department of Justice" href="http://www.justice.gov" rel="homepage">Justice Department</a> <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/August/11-at-1118.html">filed a lawsuit to block the proposed deal.</a> I strongly believe that there would be no benefits to consumers from this acquisition. All AT&amp;T is doing is eliminating a major competitor. If you're on T-Mobile, you probably realize that you have access to some of the cheapest prices available in the wireless industry, as well as decent coverage. If AT&amp;T acquires T-Mobile, it's fairly obvious that they will change the pricing scheme to match that of their own, allowing them to force consumers into paying a lot more for their wireless service. Service charges are <em>already</em> high as it is, with more carriers charging more money for lesser or equal amounts of features and unlimited data service disappearing in favor of a tiered pricing model, we simply can't afford to lose a huge competitor to the major cellular carriers. I believe that everyone who owns a cellular phone in America will be, in some way, hurt by this deal. As consumers, we simply cannot allow AT&amp;T to acquire T-Mobile. The only possible outcome is less competition, less choice in wireless devices, higher prices, and less jobs in the wireless industry.</p>
