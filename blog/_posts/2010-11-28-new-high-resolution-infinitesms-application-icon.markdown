<p>Following the trend of creating <a class="zem_slink" title="Image resolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution">high resolution</a> application icons, I finished creating a new, high resolution application icon for InfiniteSMS. Personally, I don't like this one as much as some of my other icons, but I didn't want to spend too much time working on a new icon for InfiniteSMS when it's more important to make sure that the application works well, and supports as many Android devices as possible. For this one, I was going for a cold, icy look, to match the light blue coloration of the existing InfiniteSMS icon. Anyways, here is the new high resolution icon for InfiniteSMS:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-923 alignnone" title="InfiniteSMS High Resolution Application Icon" src="/images/blog/2010/12/infinitesms-logo-hires-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<div class="zemanta-pixie" style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: medium none; float: right;" src="/images/blog/2010/12/pixy10.gif" alt="" /></div>
