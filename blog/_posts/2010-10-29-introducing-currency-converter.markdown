  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;10&#47;logo-gold-2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-716" title="Currency Converter Logo" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;10&#47;logo-gold-2.png" alt="" width="165" height="165" &#47;><&#47;a>So a couple of days ago I hinted that I was working on a <a class="zem_slink" title="Classified information" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Classified_information">top-secret<&#47;a> project. Well, that project is top-secret no more, as <a class="zem_slink" title="Exchange rate" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Exchange_rate">Currency Converter<&#47;a> is now available for free in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a>! Currency Converter is a basic application that I originally created in order to practice making Android <a class="zem_slink" title="Application software" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Application_software">applications<&#47;a>, and to play around with <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface design" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_interface_design">user interface design<&#47;a>, in an effort to create a professional-looking Android application. I am pleased to announce that this application ended up being much greater than I originally thought possible. Currency Converter is a extremely data-light application that uses less than 1.5 kilobytes of data every time it refreshes the currency exchange rates. That's rather impressive, considering the fact that Currency Converter supports <strong>94 different international <a class="zem_slink" title="Currency" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Currency">currencies<&#47;a><&#47;strong>. The exchange rates are automatically loaded from the <a class="zem_slink" title="Internet" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Internet">Internet<&#47;a> in the form of a comma separated value file that contains the latest <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Finance" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Google_Finance">Google Finance<&#47;a> currency rates by using the <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;google.com">Google<&#47;a> Spreadsheet <a class="zem_slink" title="Application programming interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Application_programming_interface">API<&#47;a>, and querying a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;spreadsheets.google.com&#47;ccc?key=0Aj41QC-LDaHudEFWdk9CTTBLVGQ1ZWlXWmdGRW1fWkE&amp;hl=en">specially formatted Google Spreadsheet document<&#47;a> that I created specifically for this application. In order to minimize data usage, the <a class="zem_slink" title="Spreadsheet" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Spreadsheet">spreadsheet<&#47;a> only contains the current exchange rate of one <a class="zem_slink" title="U.S. Dollar (USD)" rel="wikinvest" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wikinvest.com&#47;concept&#47;U.S._Dollar_%28USD%29">US dollar<&#47;a> to every other supported currency. Because the spreadsheet uses the Google Finance formula function, the spreadsheet is automatically updated with the latest rates. Regularly the Google Finance function is used to retrieve the latest stock quotes, but by inserting "<strong>CURRENCY:<&#47;strong>" into the function, we can use it to convert currency. For example, to convert one US dollar to Euros, we would use: '<strong>=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")<&#47;strong>' as our function, where 'USD' is the 'from' currency's symbol, and 'EUR' is the 'to' currency's symbol. However, adding the full Google Spreadsheet API to the application would add bloat, and that wouldn't be very good. After all, we only need to retrieve the data, we don't need to do any server side manipulation or anything. Therefore, I used the next best thing. Google has a feature on their server that allows you to run a basic query on the feed of a publicly published and accessible spreadsheet document.&Acirc;&nbsp; Because I love sharing useful things that I make, the spreadsheet document used by my currency converter is completely publicly accessible, and I have no plans on restricting access in the future. By using the query "<strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Select (SQL)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Select_%28SQL%29">SELECT<&#47;a> A,B<&#47;strong>", we can retrieve all the data in columns A and B of the spreadsheet. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;spreadsheets.google.com&#47;tq?tqx=out:html&amp;tq=select%20A,B&amp;key=0Aj41QC-LDaHudEFWdk9CTTBLVGQ1ZWlXWmdGRW1fWkE">Click here<&#47;a> to see an <a class="zem_slink" title="HTML" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;HTML">HTML<&#47;a> representation of the data that query returns. So, we now have a very basic, stripped down version of the spreadsheet that can be accessed without being logged in, but it has a lot of extra data that we don't need, and it would be annoying to parse out. Maybe it's possible to optimize the server output even more? Of course it is! Google offers the ability to retrieve any spreadsheet document as a comma separated value file that's extremely minimalistic and optimized with almost no excess data. In this case, we can simple set the <a class="zem_slink" title="PHP" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;PHP">PHP<&#47;a> GET parameter called "<strong>tqx<&#47;strong>" to "<strong>out:csv<&#47;strong>". This results in a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Ftq%3Ftqx%3Dout%3Acsv%26tq%3Dselect%2520A%2CB%26key%3D0Aj41QC-LDaHudEFWdk9CTTBLVGQ1ZWlXWmdGRW1fWkE">much smaller and easier to parse file<&#47;a> being returned by the server. Currency Converter is now available on the Android market for free. Check it out, and if you don't like it, you can always uninstall it. Let me know what you think. To easily get to the download page in the Android market, simply scan the following <a class="zem_slink" title="QR code" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fastcompany.com&#47;1585822&#47;business-card-just-scan-my-qr-code">QR code<&#47;a><span class="zem_slink"> with a barcode scanning application<&#47;span>:</p>
