<p>I added sound to "Simple Dice" when you roll the <a class="zem_slink" title="Dice" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice">dice</a>. The sound played is a modified, low quality version of <a href="http://soundbible.com/182-Shake-And-Roll-Dice.html">Mike Koenig's "Shake and Roll Dice Sound"</a>. The file takes up less than 10 additional <a class="zem_slink" title="Kilobyte" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilobyte">kilobytes</a>, and the sound is only played if the "Media volume" is not muted, to avoid disturbing others.Â  I also plan on adding the sound to "Dice Betting" when it is released. The sound truly makes the application more realistic feeling and more interesting. Expect to see the changes on <a class="zem_slink" title="GitHub" rel="homepage" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a> shortly!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The sounds are now in the git repository, and the new version is up on the market!</p>
