<p>Just like I did with the free version of EliteBomb, I created a 512 x 512 icon for EliteBomb Plus. I spent significantly longer making the icon for EliteBomb plus, so I hope you guys enjoy it. These high resolution icons are mandatory for Android applications now, and I think Google has big plans for them. I personally think the "EliteBomb" text at the bottom is just a little bit too dark, and this icon is subject to change later, but for now, just check out the new high resolution icon for EliteBomb Plus, and let me know what you think:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-882" href="/pages/blog/2010/11/18/elitebomb-plus-high-resolution-application-icon-done/elitebomb-hires-plus/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-882 alignnone" title="EliteBomb Plus High Resolution Application Icon" src="/images/blog/2010/11/elitebomb-hires-plus-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It would appear that this logo came out great after Google's compression. There's barely any visible compression artifacts. <a href="/?attachment_id=884">See for yourself</a>!</p>
