<p>The most requested feature in <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> Calculator, network selection, is coming soon to the pro version. With this new feature, you can simply click the "select <a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network">wireless network</a>" button, then click on any FiOS network that is either remembered on the device, or within range. This will make instantly calculating default Verizon FiOS WEP keys even easier and quicker, and will tremendously improve the user experience. I'm currently working on fixing all of the bugs, but you can expect this to be available on the market very soon.</p>
