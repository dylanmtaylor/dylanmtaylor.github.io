<p>EliteBomb is now optimized for rooted devices (as of version 1.3). If you have a rooted device, EliteBomb now offers you the option to remove the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS</a> text message sending limitations on your device, which prevents the message that says EliteBomb is sending a large amount of text messages from appearing. This new feature significantly improves the sending speed and quantity of messages that can be sent on rooted phones. Please note that in order for the changes to take effect, EliteBomb will need to reboot your phone, and this will cause you to lose the message that you have entered. If you are a user with EliteBomb on a non-rooted device, you don't have to do anything in order to keep using EliteBomb; It will continue to work on your device, as it always has. The same version of the application automatically detects whether your device is rooted, and adjusts accordingly. There is no need to install a different version of the application, just download the new update. Enjoy! :)</p>
