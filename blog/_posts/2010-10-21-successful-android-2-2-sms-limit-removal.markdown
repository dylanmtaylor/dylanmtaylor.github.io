<p>An EliteBomb user, Jacob Miller, and myself managed to get the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS<&#47;a> limit removed successfully in Android 2.2 on his <a class="zem_slink" title="Motorola Droid" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Motorola_Droid">Motorola Droid<&#47;a> (Original). I'd like to personally thank Jacob for spending the time with me in the chat in order to get the limit removed on his phone. The process on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;10&#47;19&#47;closer-to-a-proper-froyo-limit-removal-fix&#47;">the post that describes how to remove the SMS sending manually<&#47;a> has been updated to reflect what we had to do in order to get it to work. If you have a rooted Android device running version 2.2 (Froyo), and you have not been able to automatically remove your SMS sending limitation automatically, I highly recommend trying the method on that post, as I now know that it works. In addition to Jacob's Droid, I personally managed to get the limit removal working perfectly in an Android 2.2 <a class="zem_slink" title="Virtual machine" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Virtual_machine">virtual machine<&#47;a> running in the Android emulator included in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android software<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Software development kit" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Software_development_kit">development kit<&#47;a>. I now know exactly how to remove the limit manually on most devices, and I <em>really<&#47;em> hope to have an automated limit removal tool out soon. If you try that method, and experience issues, do <strong>not<&#47;strong> hesitate to contact me, so I could try to get the limit on your device removed. This marks a new milestone for SMS limit removal, as nobody else has any documentation on how to remove the SMS sending limit in Android 2.2 yet. Thanks to everyone who notified me of the issue, and all of you who purchased EliteBomb Plus, which encouraged me to work on getting the limit removal working. I couldn't have done it without you guys! :)</p>
