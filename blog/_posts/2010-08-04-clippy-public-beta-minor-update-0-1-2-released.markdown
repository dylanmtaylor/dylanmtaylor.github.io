  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizedRankings.com\"

  content: hello there and thank you for your info &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; I have definitely
    picked up something new from right here. I did however expertise a few technical
    points using this site, as I experienced to reload the website many times previous
    to I could get it to load correctly. I had been wondering if your web host is
    OK? Not that I'm complaining, but slow loading instances times will often affect
    your placement in google and can damage your high quality score if advertising
    and marketing with Adwords. Anyway I am adding this RSS to my email and could
    look out for a lot more of your respective fascinating content. Make sure you
    update this again very soon..

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;12&#47;clippy-logo1.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Clippy Logo" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;clippy-logo1.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" &#47;><&#47;a>I just released an update that fixes the force close on the About tab. Since most people haven't even updated to version 0.1.1 yet, you probably won't have two updates installed. I'm going to continue looking for <a class="zem_slink" title="Software bug" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Software_bug">bugs<&#47;a> and making minor improvements before I start adding new features. Because of the recent force close problems, I'm currently focusing on making the application as stable as possible. Also, there is a pretty good chance that throughout the beta period, I might make significant changes to the database, and you may lose your clippings. Before that happens, I plan on adding the ability to export your clippings database to an <a class="zem_slink" title="Secure Digital" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Secure_Digital">SD card<&#47;a>, however, I want to put this warning out there, so that you are prepared when that happens. Try not to use Clippy Beta for anything very important, and make sure there isn't anything too valuable in your Clippings database before you upgrade. In the case that I make changes to the database in order to add new features, I will make a post on my blog ahead of time, so that you can safely backup your data. I suggest you check my blog to see if I made any major changes to the database system before upgrading. If I do make any significant changes, I will change the version number more than I do for minor upgrades. If you see a small increase in the version number, such as 0.1.1 to 0.1.2, chances are it's only a <a class="zem_slink" title="Patch (computing)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Patch_%28computing%29">bug fix<&#47;a> release, or I only added a couple extra features. However, if the version number increases significantly, such as 0.1.2 to 0.2, make sure you check out my blog to see if you will lose any data. Keep in mind, this is a <a class="zem_slink" title="Software release life cycle" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Software_release_life_cycle">beta release<&#47;a> for a reason. There is a rapid release cycle, and the code for the application isn't very stable. Things will change rapidly, and you should always be prepared for the worst. That being said, I hope you enjoy beta testing Clippy, and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback about it, and I look forward to seeing how you guys feel about the changes I make.</p>
