  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.WhiteHatSeoRankings.com\"

  content: "That's how I started my \"primal\" lifestyle: this diet exactly. I shed
    a good 24-25lbs in less than 3 months. But I reached homeostasis after that, like
    my body telling me: man, that's your ideal weight, no need to shed further fat,
    I am fine like that. However, even though I was much leaner, I still carried a
    bit of belly fat (subcutaneous - often called stubborn fat). Only one thing to
    do: trick the body into believing that this fat had to be burnt as well -> heavy
    weight lifting, high intensity interval training and low fat - higher carb reloading
    at days with intense work-out. And most of all: PLENTY OF SLEEP! That did it :)\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

This is a free and <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open<&#47;a> source license in the truest sense of those words. However, I completely forgot about the images and other resources used in the game, which are necessary in order to <a class="zem_slink" title="Compiler" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Compiler">compile<&#47;a> and play the game. Of course, it's really easy to create similar images from scratch, but I decided to allow everyone to use and modify the images included with the game however they want to. Therefore, I am now licensing all images and other resources that I created under the<strong> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;creativecommons.org&#47;licenses&#47;by&#47;3.0&#47;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<&#47;a><&#47;strong>, which is also an extremely lenient content license. Although I'm not exactly sure what "Unported" means, the license is free, and I'm glad to let others use my work however they want to. If anyone with a legal background wants to clarify that, that would be great. Although I have a link to more information in this post, I'm going to attempt to summarize the license anyways. Basically, the license allows you to copy, distribute, modify, and transmit any of the resources in "Catch the Ball", and you don't have to pay me anything, what-so-ever in order to do so, as long as you give me credit for creating the resources. Giving me credit could be as simple as posting a link that looks something like "<a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;">Dylan Taylor<&#47;a> &#47; <a rel="license" href="http:&#47;&#47;creativecommons.org&#47;licenses&#47;by&#47;3.0&#47;">CC BY 3.0<&#47;a>" in a spot where users of the application that incorporates my work will see it, or simply mentioning that your application uses artwork by Dylan Taylor that is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License in your "<a class="zem_slink" title="README" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;README">README<&#47;a>" file or included documentation. Anyways, here's a Creative Commons badge that links to the full-page describing the license in more detail:<br />
