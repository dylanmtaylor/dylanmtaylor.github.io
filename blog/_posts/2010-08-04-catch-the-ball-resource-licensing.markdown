This is a free and <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open<&#47;a> source license in the truest sense of those words. However, I completely forgot about the images and other resources used in the game, which are necessary in order to <a class="zem_slink" title="Compiler" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Compiler">compile<&#47;a> and play the game. Of course, it's really easy to create similar images from scratch, but I decided to allow everyone to use and modify the images included with the game however they want to. Therefore, I am now licensing all images and other resources that I created under the<strong> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;creativecommons.org&#47;licenses&#47;by&#47;3.0&#47;">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License<&#47;a><&#47;strong>, which is also an extremely lenient content license. Although I'm not exactly sure what "Unported" means, the license is free, and I'm glad to let others use my work however they want to. If anyone with a legal background wants to clarify that, that would be great. Although I have a link to more information in this post, I'm going to attempt to summarize the license anyways. Basically, the license allows you to copy, distribute, modify, and transmit any of the resources in "Catch the Ball", and you don't have to pay me anything, what-so-ever in order to do so, as long as you give me credit for creating the resources. Giving me credit could be as simple as posting a link that looks something like "<a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;">Dylan Taylor<&#47;a> &#47; <a rel="license" href="http:&#47;&#47;creativecommons.org&#47;licenses&#47;by&#47;3.0&#47;">CC BY 3.0<&#47;a>" in a spot where users of the application that incorporates my work will see it, or simply mentioning that your application uses artwork by Dylan Taylor that is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License in your "<a class="zem_slink" title="README" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;README">README<&#47;a>" file or included documentation. Anyways, here's a Creative Commons badge that links to the full-page describing the license in more detail:<br />
