It's called "<em>Clippy<&#47;em>", and it will let you manage your <a class="zem_slink" title="Clipboard" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Clipboard">clipboard<&#47;a>. I just started this project today, so it's obviously in an extremely early alpha format, but check back soon to see more details. Even though I don't think my image editing skills are that great, the logo came out surprisingly good. Anyways, Clippy will allow you to view your current clipboard, save it for later, retrieve saved clipboards, and manipulate previous clipboards by applying text filters to them. I plan on releasing Clippy for free on the Android market, but it will most likely be supported by advertisements, especially since I only made like <strong>$0.56<&#47;strong> so far from people clicking the advertisement in <a title="FiOS WEP Calc Lite" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;07&#47;30&#47;fios-wep-calculator-lite-edition-is-up-and-running&#47;">FiOS WEP Calc Lite<&#47;a>. I will also probably release an advertisement-free version for <strong>$0.99<&#47;strong>, the minimum price that I can sell an application for on the Android market some time in the future, once I get my account set-up to accept payments through <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;google.com">Google<&#47;a> Checkout.</p>
