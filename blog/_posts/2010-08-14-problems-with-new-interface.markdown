  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.WhiteHatSeoRankings.com\"

    to be on the internet the easiest thing to be aware of. I say to you, I definitely
    get annoyed while people think about worries that they plainly do not know about.
    You managed to hit the nail upon the top and defined out the whole thing without
    having side effect , people could take a signal. Will probably be back to get
    more. Thanks

    gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said "You can hear the ocean if you put
    this to your ear." She placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit
    crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this
    is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!

<p>I wish I could release the new interface and show you guys it, but I'm still working out some bugs. For instance, you can't currently save clippings, even though it asks you for the title, and there is a save button. Also, the previously working "Filters" menu is no longer functioning. Due to these problems, and several others, I am delaying the release of the new Clippy interface.</p>
