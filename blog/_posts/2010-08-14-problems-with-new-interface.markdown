<p>I wish I could release the new interface and show you guys it, but I'm still working out some bugs. For instance, you can't currently save clippings, even though it asks you for the title, and there is a save button. Also, the previously working "Filters" menu is no longer functioning. Due to these problems, and several others, I am delaying the release of the new Clippy interface.</p>
