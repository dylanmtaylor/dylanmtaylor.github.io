<p>After discovering a bug in <a class="zem_slink" title="Lexmark" rel="homepage" href="http://www.lexmark.com/">Lexmark</a>'s Debian installer, as described in <a href="http://dylanmtaylor.com/2011/04/17/fixing-lexmark-printer-driver-installation-in-ubuntu-11-04/">my previous post</a>, and reporting it to Lexmark's support team, I found a response from Lexmark in my inbox, which was sent on the 18th, and I decided to share it on my blog to show that Lexmark is aware of the issue, and they are actively working on resolving it. Here is the message I received from Lexmark Support:</p>

<div>The driver installation failed because there was a typo in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Lua (programming language)" rel="homepage" href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code">source code</a> for the <a class="zem_slink" title="Linux" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> Lexmark <a class="zem_slink" title="Printer driver" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_driver">printer driver</a>. To be specific, the variable "ownership" was misspelled as "ownhership" in one of the lines of the source code. While this is a very easy to fix bug, it prevents the Linux installer from working at all, and I am happy to hear that Lexmark knows about the issue now, and it's likely that a quick fix will be released. Hopefully this will eliminate the need for my workaround, and simplify Linux printer driver installation.</div>
