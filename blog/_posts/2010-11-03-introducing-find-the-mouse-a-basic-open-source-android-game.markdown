<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;justmouse.png"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-736" title="Public Domain Mouse Image" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;justmouse.png?w=150" alt="" width="150" height="150" &#47;><&#47;a>So, a friend of mine asked me to show them how to make a basic Android game, which resulted in me coding up something simple for him. "Find The Mouse" is the result of this coding. This entire game was started and finished in around 20 minutes today, and the counter was added in later. All of the artwork in the game is <a class="zem_slink" title="Public domain" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Public_domain">public domain<&#47;a> artwork found on sites like clker.com. The card background was heavily modified in order to reduce <a class="zem_slink" title="File size" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;File_size">file size<&#47;a> and make it look nicer on mobile screens. The object of the game is to find the mouse hidden behind one of five cards. You have three chances to find the mouse before you lose. The game is, as I stated earlier, incredibly simple, yet somewhat useful to someone who is learning to code for the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android operating system<&#47;a>. The entire <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Source_code">source code<&#47;a> as well as all resources are available on <a class="zem_slink" title="GitHub" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com">GitHub<&#47;a>, and I will probably end up putting this on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a> soon, so that all of you without the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android SDK" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;developer.android.com&#47;sdk&#47;index.html">Android SDK<&#47;a> or the time to compile source code can play with this. This game will definitely be 100% free, and I have no intention of ever charging for it. The version on the market will likely have an <a class="zem_slink" title="AdMob" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.admob.com">AdMob<&#47;a> advertisement in it, however, the version on github will not if you have the time to compile it and run it yourself. I am releasing this project under version 3 of the <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU General Public License" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License<&#47;a>, and all original artwork created by me in relation to this project is released to the public domain.
