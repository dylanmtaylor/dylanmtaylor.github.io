    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait

    have ever assumed that men and women would essentially print out words on paper
    just to have it sent through the mail to another person's mailbox. Next thing
    you know, peoe is going to be growing their own food and walking or riding bikes
    everywhere. It'll by no means do the job, damn progress.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;www.iyI5PdipBUiyI5PdipBU.com&#47;iyI5PdipBUiyI5PdipBU"

EliteGuard is an application that is able to block SMS bombing attacks with a very minimal impact on battery life consumption. EliteGuard is automatically started when your device turns on, and can be easily disabled with a single click inside the EliteGuard application. I have personally tested EliteGuard, and it works wonderfully on my <a class="zem_slink" title="Samsung i9000 Galaxy S" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Samsung_i9000_Galaxy_S">Samsung Epic 4G<&#47;a>, and I am barely even able to tell that it's running. Because EliteGuard runs passively, meaning that it only checks for an SMS bombing attack upon receiving an <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS message<&#47;a>, EliteGuard uses absolutely no additional <a class="zem_slink" title="Battery (electricity)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Battery_%28electricity%29">battery power<&#47;a> unless you receive an SMS. EliteBomb is currently in an early stage of development, so there are not very many features yet, but I plan on improving it and adding many more features in the future, such as the ability to view a log of messages received and how many of each message was received. At the moment, EliteGuard keeps track of those statistics internally, but nothing is actually displayed to the user. EliteGuard is currently available in the Android market for <strong>$1.99<&#47;strong>, and I highly recommend getting it. It's the perfect compliment to EliteBomb Plus. Also, here is the high resolution application icon that I used for EliteGuard:</p>
