EliteGuard is an application that is able to block SMS bombing attacks with a very minimal impact on battery life consumption. EliteGuard is automatically started when your device turns on, and can be easily disabled with a single click inside the EliteGuard application. I have personally tested EliteGuard, and it works wonderfully on my <a class="zem_slink" title="Samsung i9000 Galaxy S" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Samsung_i9000_Galaxy_S">Samsung Epic 4G<&#47;a>, and I am barely even able to tell that it's running. Because EliteGuard runs passively, meaning that it only checks for an SMS bombing attack upon receiving an <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS message<&#47;a>, EliteGuard uses absolutely no additional <a class="zem_slink" title="Battery (electricity)" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Battery_%28electricity%29">battery power<&#47;a> unless you receive an SMS. EliteBomb is currently in an early stage of development, so there are not very many features yet, but I plan on improving it and adding many more features in the future, such as the ability to view a log of messages received and how many of each message was received. At the moment, EliteGuard keeps track of those statistics internally, but nothing is actually displayed to the user. EliteGuard is currently available in the Android market for <strong>$1.99<&#47;strong>, and I highly recommend getting it. It's the perfect compliment to EliteBomb Plus. Also, here is the high resolution application icon that I used for EliteGuard:</p>
