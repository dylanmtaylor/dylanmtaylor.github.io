<p>In order to give <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> Calculator Lite users a taste of the Pro version, and boost sales, I decided to allow users to preview the network selection feature, but not actually "select" the network unless it is remembered on the device. What this means is that they will get a listing of remembered and nearby access point listings,Â  but they will only be able to select and calculate WEP keys for 'remembered' <a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless access point" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">access points</a> automatically. They will still be able to view a listing of nearby access points, but they will not be able to select them. Having this feature will still improve the overall experience, while still giving users a reason to purchase FiOS WEP Calculator Pro.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>I finished adding the new features to the lite version, and an update is available in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>. The new version of FiOS WEP Calculator brings the ability to view nearby and remembered FiOS networks, previously only available to pro users. In order to select nearby networks (not remembered ones) automatically, you need to upgrade to the pro version, but you can now view a list of nearby networks without paying for FiOS WEP Calculator Pro.</p>
