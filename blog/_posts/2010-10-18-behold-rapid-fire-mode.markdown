<p>Some of you have been wondering why there have been several releases in a row. I have been working on fixing as many crashes as possible, and preparing to introduce the one feature that will set EliteBomb Plus worlds apart from EliteBomb, without removing anything currently in EliteBomb. Rapid Fire Mode sends <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS messages</a> in rapid succession, without waiting for any previous messages to send, resulting in <em>much </em>faster message sending. This feature will be available in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a> soon for all "Plus" users. Please note that rapid fire mode is very experimental, and unstable. It is not recommended with unlimited, or any "high" numbers of messages.</p>
