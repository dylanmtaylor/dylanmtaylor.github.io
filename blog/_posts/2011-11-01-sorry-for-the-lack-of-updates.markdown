<p>I've been fairly busy lately (more than usual), and I realize I haven't updated my site in quite some time now. There have been several significant changes with LibreScribe. The full details are available in the commit log on github, but most importantly, LibreScribe now functions to the point where pages can actually be pulled from the device, rendered, and displayed in the native image viewer on the system. I'll try to post some more updates soon and get more work done on LibreScribe in the near future.</p>
