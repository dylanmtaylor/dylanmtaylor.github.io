  content: "Hi Dylan,\r\nI just found your librescribe project and, as the owner of
    a livescribe echo, am very interested in it. I cloned the project from github
    and did \"make\", but get this error:\r\n\r\n.&#47;wx_pch.h:21:23: fatal error:
    wx&#47;wxprec.h: No such file or directory\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake:
    *** [obj&#47;Debug&#47;AboutDialog.o] Error 1\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Also, if I can
    get it to build, would I do \"make install\" to install it? I'd feel more comfortable
    with a little documentation explaining what it installs and how to remove it :-)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

    and making it available to open source community. I bought a Livescribe pen before
    I found out that they had stopped selling and supporting their SDK. I have some
    ideas which requires me to access the pen directly from an application.\r\nWould

    from it, but we would probably benefit more from Google taking it over. In the
    case of Google+ it is just a matter of time. Facebook was lucky it didn't seriously
    really have to compete with something as \"good\" as facebook, the competition
    was just lacking a lot of features along with a global approach.Google+ is superior
    to Facebook, however it has a bigger challenge to receive popular.Just look at
    VHS and Betamax. Betamax was better but lost due to bad marketing&#47;licensing.Danny

<p>I've been fairly busy lately (more than usual), and I realize I haven't updated my site in quite some time now. There have been several significant changes with LibreScribe. The full details are available in the commit log on github, but most importantly, LibreScribe now functions to the point where pages can actually be pulled from the device, rendered, and displayed in the native image viewer on the system. I'll try to post some more updates soon and get more work done on LibreScribe in the near future.</p>
