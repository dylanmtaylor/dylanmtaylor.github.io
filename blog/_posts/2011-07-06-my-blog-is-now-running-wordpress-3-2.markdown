<p>Yesterday I upgraded my blog to the new major revision of the <a class="zem_slink" title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org" rel="homepage">WordPress</a> blogging platform, version 3.2, as soon as it was publicly released. In only a day, the new version was downloaded over 330,000 times. The new version of WordPress is supposedly<a href="http://wpcandy.com/presents/everything-we-know-about-wordpress-3-2"> much lighter and faster</a> than the previous iteration, as a lot of bloat has been removed and a lot of the code was optimized to be more efficient. The new version features a new admin panel and an HTML5 compatible default theme. Overall, I am pleased with the new version of WordPress, and I'm looking forward to even more positive changes to the platform in the future.</p>
