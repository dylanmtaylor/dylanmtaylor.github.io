<p>It's been a <em>very </em>long time since I last worked on my Verizon <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> key calculator website. Over the last few days, I decided that it looked dated, and I decided to make it look a lot cleaner, using the magic of <a class="zem_slink" title="Cascading Style Sheets" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS3</a>. I removed several images from the site, such as the header image, and the background gradient image, and I replaced them with a pure CSS-based approach, reducing the total page size from just above 12Kb to only 6.5Kb, and significantly reducing the already low amount of time taken to load the page, as well as making it feel more modern. The page loads, literally, almost instantly now, even on a <a class="zem_slink" title="Dial-up Internet access" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access">dial-up connection</a>, which is rather impressive if you ask me.  I think visitors will like the new look of <a href="http://fwc.dylanmtaylor.com/">my FiOS WEP key calculator site</a>, and if you have any feedback about it, feel free to leave a comment on this post.</p>
