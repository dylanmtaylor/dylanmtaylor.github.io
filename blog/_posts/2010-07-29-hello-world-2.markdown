<p>My name is Dylan Taylor, and this is my new blog. The site is still under construction, so expect a lot of <span class="zem_slink">broken links</span>, etc. I'm very interested in <a class="zem_slink" title="Technology" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology">technology</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Software development" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">software development</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> software. I'm not sure what I'm going to put here yet, but check back occasionally to see if I've updated it. I plan on adding interesting articles including tutorials, reviews, information on applications I create, news, and other miscellaneous interesting content. If there's anything in particular that you would like me to write about, feel free to let me know.</p>
