<p>If you haven't noticed the trend, I've been working on creating high resolution 512 x 512 icons for my Android applications, which is now mandatory in the Android market. This icon in particular went through quite a few revisions before I was finally satisfied with the result, and I must say, it turned out a lot better than I originally thought it would, especially considering the fact that I originally created the icon at a resolution of 165 x 165 (including the space around the actual icon). Considering how much scaling, bluring, anti-aliasing, etc. I had to do in order to get this to look nice, I'm rather satisfied with the end result:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-887" href="/pages/blog/2010/11/19/currency-converter-high-resolution-application-icon-done/hq-icon-plain-4/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-887" title="Currency Converter High Resolution Application Icon" src="/images/blog/2010/11/hq-icon-plain-4-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><br />
Let me know what you think. Also, after compression by the Android market, <a href="/?attachment_id=887">the icon still looks pretty good</a>, but I really wish they would leave the original icons alone, or use lossless compression.</p>
