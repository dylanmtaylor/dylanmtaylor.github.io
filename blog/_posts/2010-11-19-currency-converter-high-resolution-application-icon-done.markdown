  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoAnalyticNews.com\"

  content: "While a person is dieting certain sacrifices need to be made such as counting
    calories or at least being more mindful of portion sizes, as well as improving
    the nutritional composition of the diet. Once you have achieved your goal, most
    people can afford to consume an extra 300-500 calories a day so that they are
    at maintenance level calories instead of being in a deficit. Assuming their metabolism
    isn't compromised from the dieting and their activity level hasn't changed too
    much, they would be in a position to reintroduce some \"carby stuff\" into the
    diet if they so choose without ill effects.\r\n\r\nhttp:&#47;&#47;redd.it&#47;2izjwm"

<p>If you haven't noticed the trend, I've been working on creating high resolution 512 x 512 icons for my Android applications, which is now mandatory in the Android market. This icon in particular went through quite a few revisions before I was finally satisfied with the result, and I must say, it turned out a lot better than I originally thought it would, especially considering the fact that I originally created the icon at a resolution of 165 x 165 (including the space around the actual icon). Considering how much scaling, bluring, anti-aliasing, etc. I had to do in order to get this to look nice, I'm rather satisfied with the end result:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-887" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;19&#47;currency-converter-high-resolution-application-icon-done&#47;hq-icon-plain-4&#47;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-887" title="Currency Converter High Resolution Application Icon" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;hq-icon-plain-4-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a><br />
Let me know what you think. Also, after compression by the Android market, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;?attachment_id=887">the icon still looks pretty good<&#47;a>, but I really wish they would leave the original icons alone, or use lossless compression.</p>
