<p>If you haven't noticed the trend, I've been working on creating high resolution 512 x 512 icons for my Android applications, which is now mandatory in the Android market. This icon in particular went through quite a few revisions before I was finally satisfied with the result, and I must say, it turned out a lot better than I originally thought it would, especially considering the fact that I originally created the icon at a resolution of 165 x 165 (including the space around the actual icon). Considering how much scaling, bluring, anti-aliasing, etc. I had to do in order to get this to look nice, I'm rather satisfied with the end result:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-887" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;19&#47;currency-converter-high-resolution-application-icon-done&#47;hq-icon-plain-4&#47;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-887" title="Currency Converter High Resolution Application Icon" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;hq-icon-plain-4-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" &#47;><&#47;a><br />
Let me know what you think. Also, after compression by the Android market, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dylanmtaylor.com&#47;?attachment_id=887">the icon still looks pretty good<&#47;a>, but I really wish they would leave the original icons alone, or use lossless compression.</p>
