<p>I've been working on creating a basic <a class="zem_slink" title="List of dice games" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;List_of_dice_games">dice game<&#47;a> for <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android<&#47;a> with animation, rules, betting, and more! The game is currently a work in progress, but I'm really excited to release it! The animation works wonderfully, and the interface, although very unfinished is already starting to look polished, especially in the game's menus. For now, the game is simply called "Dice Betting", and yes, I realize how lame and generic that sounds, but I might end up changing the name of the game before it is released. Similar to "Find the Mouse", I'll probably end up open sourcing this game (under the GNU General Public License, of course), although it isn't even remotely close to being released yet. The game will have a built-in statistics tracking system, and the rolling of the dice will be completely animated. Right now, the animation I have done looks really cool, and I'm incredibly anxious to publicly release this. Check back soon! :)</p>
