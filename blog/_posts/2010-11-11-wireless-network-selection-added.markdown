<p>I finished adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Wireless network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network">wireless network</a> selection to the <strong>Pro</strong> version of <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon FiOS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="Wired Equivalent Privacy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a> Calculator. This enhancement adds tons of value for those who already purchased FiOS WEP Calculator PRO, and adds an incentive for others to do so. Overall, I'm really excited to announce this new feature, and I look forward to receiving feedback about it. Enjoy! ;)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Version 2.1 fixes a minor annoying bug where the list of networks is reset when the keyboard is opened/closed or the screen is rotated.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Version 2.3Â  fixes a significant bug that resulted in a force close when selecting certain items in the network list.</p>
