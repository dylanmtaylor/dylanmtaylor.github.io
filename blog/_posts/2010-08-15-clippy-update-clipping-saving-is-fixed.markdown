  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.2014PandaSeo.com\"

  content: Hello this is kind of of off topic but I was wondering if blogs use WYSIWYG
    editors or if you have to manually code with HTML. I'm starting a blog soon but
    have no coding expertise so I wanted to get advice from someone with experience.
    Any help would be greatly appreciated!

<p>I finally fixed the issue I was having with saving clippings. In fact, there was no problem in the first place. The reason I thought there was one, is because I was having Clippy generate sample content for the clippings page, in order to debug. Every time I went to the "Clippings" tab, the content I added was being overwritten by the sample content, making me assume it was not saving. This is no longer an issue. As soon as I finish fixing regressions, there will most likely be a new update on the market. The next step on my agenda is to have database management handled by the service.</p>
