<p>I finally fixed the issue I was having with saving clippings. In fact, there was no problem in the first place. The reason I thought there was one, is because I was having Clippy generate sample content for the clippings page, in order to debug. Every time I went to the "Clippings" tab, the content I added was being overwritten by the sample content, making me assume it was not saving. This is no longer an issue. As soon as I finish fixing regressions, there will most likely be a new update on the market. The next step on my agenda is to have database management handled by the service.</p>
