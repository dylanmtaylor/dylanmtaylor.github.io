<p>As part of the process of transitioning to the new website, I'm adding a link to every post on my old website, linking to the new website. This will ensure that visitors notice that my site has been moved, and helpfully bring all of the visitors who continue to visit my old site to the new site, as well as increasing the page ranking of my site in all of the major search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. This process should be completed within the next few days.</p>
