  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.SeoOptimizationTipz.com\"

<p>If you checked out the <a class="zem_slink" title="Source code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Source_code">source code<&#47;a> for "Catch The Ball" lately, you might have noticed that the source code wasn't compiling. The reason for this is because even though I tested the code to compile and run before committing it to the repository, I added comments to the <a class="zem_slink" title="XML" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;XML">XML<&#47;a> files, stating that the file is a part of "Catch The Ball", and that it's licensed under version 3 of the <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU General Public License" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License<&#47;a>. What I didn't realize, however, is that the line  "<strong><xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><&#47;strong>" needs to come first in the XML file, before any comments, or else the <a class="zem_slink" title="Compiler" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Compiler">compiler<&#47;a> will produce error messages. I pushed the code to the repository without realizing this, and then started working on fixing issues with Clippy, so I didn't find out about the problem until I tried to compile the Catch The Ball code again, at which point, I became extremely confused, as I knew I tested the code before committing it to git, and the only changes I made involved adding <a class="zem_slink" title="Internal documentation" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Internal_documentation">internal documentation<&#47;a> to the code, which shouldn't affect the application at all. Anyways, it's fixed now, and I just wanted to let you know.</p>
