<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Skype for Linux 2.2" src="/images/blog/2011/04/skype-for-linux4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="207" /> After approximately 15 months of waiting, Skype <em>finally</em> decided to release a new version of their software for the Linux operating system. I haven't tested the new version quite yet, but I know for sure that the old version was incredibly buggy, it always froze, and it was full of irritating bugs. Hopefully this new release of Skype will at least bring the Linux version of Skype a little bit closer to the version of Skype for the Microsoft Windows platform. Anyways, I'm going to go ahead and download the new version of Skype and try it out right now, and I'll probably update this post with my opinions on the update.</p>
