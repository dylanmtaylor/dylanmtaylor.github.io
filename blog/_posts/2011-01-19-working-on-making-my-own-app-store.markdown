It's been a lot of work, but at the same time, it's been fun and challenging, and it really helped me get reacquainted with my long-lost <a class="zem_slink" title="PHP" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.php.net&#47;">PHP<&#47;a> skills. Although there are still quite a few problems to solve (such as how users will get updates, and how application purchases will be done), the site itself for the store is finally starting to look great, and in the not-so-distant future, it should serve as a pretty good way to distribute the free versions of my applications. In order to make the user experience as good as possible, I will also be  incorporating some of the new features introduced in HTML5. The site as it is takes advantages of exciting new CSS3 techniques, <a class="zem_slink" title="JavaScript" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;JavaScript">JavaScript<&#47;a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="Web typography" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Web_typography">web fonts<&#47;a>.&Acirc;&nbsp; Personally, I believe that the site will look great when it's finished, and I can't wait to release it! There is still a <em>lot<&#47;em> more work to be done, but I believe that I have reached a significant milestone in the process of releasing this to the public, and I realized that I haven't written very much for quite some time now, so I wanted to let you guys know that I've been busy coding, and I have no intention of giving up coding. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
<p>Fun Fact<em>:<&#47;em> This post contains the <em>brand new<&#47;em> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;html&#47;logo&#47;">official HTML5 logo<&#47;a>, which practically just came out.</p>
