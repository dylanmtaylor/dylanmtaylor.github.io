  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,
    just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.WhiteHatSeoRankings.com\"

  content: I and my guys ended up reading the excellent helpful tips located on your
    web site and then at once got a terrible suspicion I had not expressed respect
    to the blog owner for them. All the men appeared to be for that reason stimulated
    to learn them and now have really been enjoying them. Many thanks for indeed being
    indeed accommodating and then for settling on this kind of helpful guides most
    people are really eager to discover. My sincere apologies for not expressing gratitude
    to earlier.

<p>So, <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;google.com">Google<&#47;a> made some changes in how the settings databases work in <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android 2.2<&#47;a>, which causes the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS<&#47;a> limit removal tool in EliteBomb to not work successfully on Froyo devices (running 2.2). The removal trick currently works on devices running 2.1 or earlier. I am working with some users who have Froyo devices in order to get the feature working on their devices, and I hope to have a fix out soon. Keep in mind that since I myself do not actually have an Android 2.2 device (unfortunately), there may be some trial and error involved. Rest assured that I will continue to work hard in order to get this hack working on as many devices as possible. In order to apply the new hack once it's released, you may have to use the context menu (by pressing the <strong>Menu<&#47;strong> button), and select "Remove SMS Limits". I apologize for any inconvenience and&#47;or difficulties this has caused. Check back soon for more updates on the status of the fix.</p>
