<p>So, <a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a> made some changes in how the settings databases work in <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android 2.2</a>, which causes the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS</a> limit removal tool in EliteBomb to not work successfully on Froyo devices (running 2.2). The removal trick currently works on devices running 2.1 or earlier. I am working with some users who have Froyo devices in order to get the feature working on their devices, and I hope to have a fix out soon. Keep in mind that since I myself do not actually have an Android 2.2 device (unfortunately), there may be some trial and error involved. Rest assured that I will continue to work hard in order to get this hack working on as many devices as possible. In order to apply the new hack once it's released, you may have to use the context menu (by pressing the <strong>Menu</strong> button), and select "Remove SMS Limits". I apologize for any inconvenience and/or difficulties this has caused. Check back soon for more updates on the status of the fix.</p>
