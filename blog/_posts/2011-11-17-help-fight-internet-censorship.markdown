<p>If you didn't notice yet, I modified the theme of my site, in particular header.php, in order to show a black censorship bar over my site's heading. Why? There is a law being passed that aims to completely censor the internet in the name of stopping copyright infringement. The impact of such a bill is much more far-reaching than just copyright infringement. This could completely change the way that we use and experience the internet. I encourage everyone reading this to visit <a href="http://americancensorship.org/">http://americancensorship.org</a> and show their support. Let's stand up together to fight for a free internet where information isn't restricted! Just look at what it's like in China, the level of censorship on the internet through the "great firewall of China" is astounding!</p>
