<p>EliteBomb Plus 2.6 is just another release that is just an attempt to fix the automatic <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android 2.2</a> SMS limit removal. If you download this new release and have a rooted device, <em>please</em>, let me know if you get it working. Thanks! I will have a similar version of the free version of EliteBomb out soon! If it still doesn't work, feel free to try to <a href=/pages/blog/2010/10/19/closer-to-a-proper-froyo-limit-removal-fix/">remove the limitation manually</a>.</p>
