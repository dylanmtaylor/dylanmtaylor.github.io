  content: Dylan, thanks a lot for working on this issue of Livescribe usage in Linux.
    I work in social sciences and the Livescribe pen makes interview recording much
    easier and more transparent. However, because I am a linux user, I am the only
    one in the working group not using the pen, but a MP3 speech recorder and standard
    pen&#47;paper. Great work! And I hope that it will improve and some people will
    help out. As the Livescribe guys are generally very friendly (as I have seen in
    the forum and in the replies to my request of Linux support), they might even
    help you out a bit and devote some hours of their coders to your project. Just
    ask them. It is worth trying.

  content: 'I''ve been just looking for a Linux Version of the LiveScribe Desktop
    and found this blog. We do use two PulsePens of which on we''re sincronizing with
    Mac-OS-X and the other one with Windows. As Windows will be replaced by Linux
    (debian) i''m hihgly interested in your project as this would even give a chance
    to another wish: A Linux based server for exchange of Pencasts.'

  content: Right now it won't, as the program explicitly searches for devices manufactured
    by LiveScribe, and it's currently designed to work with LiveScribe pens only.
    If you're right and the pen is in fact very similar to a LiveScribe pen, I would
    be willing to try to make the software work with the Logitech IO2 pen in the future,
    however, since I don't own a Logitech IO2 pen, and it would be a _ton_ of additional
    work to make it work with a non-LiveScribe devices, the functionality would have
    to be coded by someone else. However, it would be great to have LibreScribe work
    with a Logitech IO2 pen as well, as it would allow several developers to work
    on one project instead of duplicating the effort.

  content: Hi, great project. Unfortunately I could not compile it on my Ubuntu installation
    yet. But I wont give up. If you like, I could volunteer to port the program to
    Android-Tablets. It could be very handy to use it together with the Tablet PCs.
    Some have already a USB-(Host)-Plug. I have ported an interface to the Voltcraft
    Dataloggers to Android already and could use this experience.

  content: "Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factors,
    for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that you are
    not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Page SEO means
    more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No longer are backlinks
    and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to getting Google PageRank
    or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what is good On-Page SEO?First
    your keyword must appear in the title.Then it must appear in the URL.You have
    to optimize your keyword and make sure that it has a nice keyword density of 3-5%
    in your article with relevant LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). Then you should
    spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your article.Your Keyword should appear in your first
    paragraph and in the last sentence of the page. You should have relevant usage
    of Bold and italics of your keyword.There should be one internal link to a page
    on your blog and you should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait
    there's even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that
    does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATICALLY,

Over the past few days, I've been working on attempting to code an <a class="zem_slink" title="Open source" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Open_source">open source<&#47;a> Smartpen Manager for <a class="zem_slink" title="Livescribe " rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livescribe.com">Livescribe<&#47;a> devices, based off of the work done in Steven Walter's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dasbrennen.isa-geek.org&#47;~srwalter&#47;gitweb&#47;gitweb.cgi?p=libsmartpen.git;a=summary">libsmartpen<&#47;a> project, which hasn't been updated for months. The project is called "LibreScribe", and <a title="LibreScribe on github" href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;aliendude5300&#47;LibreScribe">the source code is already on github right now<&#47;a>. The code will be written primarily in<a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;C%2B%2B"> C++<&#47;a>, with limited functionality (such as threads) from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.open-std.org&#47;jtc1&#47;sc22&#47;wg21&#47;docs&#47;papers&#47;2010&#47;n3092.pdf">the upcoming C++0x standard<&#47;a>, and it will use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wxwidgets.org&#47;">wxWidgets<&#47;a> for the <a class="zem_slink" title="Graphical user interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Graphical_user_interface">graphical user interface<&#47;a>, which will be built using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wxformbuilder.org&#47;">wxFormBuilder<&#47;a>, attempting to follow the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tango.freedesktop.org&#47;Tango_Desktop_Project">Tango guidelines<&#47;a> as close as possible. So far, I have only scratched the surface of all the coding that will be necessary, so it would be great if some of the coders reading this would step up to the plate and help out. Even small things, such as documenting functions, adding comments, ensuring source code style consistency, and making it easier to maintain the source code are incredibly important. Right now, there's still tons of work to do. So much, in fact, that it's actually easier to list what's done than what's left to do. Right now, I'm focusing on fixing bugs and writing functions to check the status of the connected Smartpen. To be more specific, some of the most important bugs at the moment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the user plugs in or unplugs the device, the background thread updates the status of the device behind the scenes, but nothing is reflected in the <a class="zem_slink" title="User interface" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;User_interface">user interface<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Clicking the "Device Information" button twice without closing the program results in a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Segmentation_fault">segmentation fault<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Currently, only <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livescribe.com&#47;en-us&#47;smartpen&#47;pulse&#47;">LiveScribe Pulse<&#47;a> devices are detected. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livescribe.com&#47;en-us&#47;smartpen&#47;echo&#47;">LiveScribe Echo<&#47;a> devices <em>should<&#47;em> work, but I can't check the <a class="zem_slink" title="Universal Serial Bus" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Universal_Serial_Bus">USB<&#47;a> product ID property of them without physical access to one.<&#47;li>
<li>The program is not currently capable of retrieving the name of the Smartpen. More <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;OBject_EXchange">OBEX<&#47;a> analysis is necessary to determine how the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.livescribe.com&#47;en-us&#47;starthere&#47;">official desktop client<&#47;a> retrieves the name of the Smartpen.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Once I have all of these bugs fixed, I will begin working on adding more of the code from libsmartpen into the project, fixing up existing code, and writing new code. This is probably one of the toughest coding projects I've started, but I enjoy the challenge, and I hope to create something genuinely useful to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Free software community" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Free_software_community">open source community<&#47;a>, improve my own coding ability, and learn new things. I frequently push changes to github, as long as I don't notice any significant regressions, so you can track my progress in almost real-time. At the moment, the user interface is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dylanmtaylor.com&#47;?attachment_id=1026"><em>far<&#47;em> from being finished (link is a screenshot)<&#47;a>, but it's not too bad. Also, feel free to fork the <a class="zem_slink" title="Codebase" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Codebase">code base<&#47;a>, and make improvements.</p>
