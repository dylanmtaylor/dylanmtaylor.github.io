<p>Continuing the pattern of updating all of my <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> applications to include the new, mandatory <a class="zem_slink" title="Image resolution" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution">high-resolution</a> application icons, I've been working on a new logo for my <a class="zem_slink" title="Dice" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice">dice</a> rolling application, Simple Dice. After messing around with it for a while, I finally managed to come up with something that looks great, and is unique when compared to my other high resolution application icons. This new icon makes use of the "<a href="http://oohlalaartsy.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-free-font-what-do-we-do-all-day.html">What Do We Do All Day</a>" font by <a href="http://oohlalaartsy.blogspot.com/">Heather Taylor</a> (no relation to me). I used a spiral background to visually symbolize the movement of rolling the dice, and layered a few copies of the dice image on top of each other in order to create an almost three dimensional look and feel, as well as a subtle glow behind the text and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice">die</a> itself. I will be using this new high resolution icon for both the free version and the $0.99 donation (advertisement-free) version of Simple Dice in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>.</p>
