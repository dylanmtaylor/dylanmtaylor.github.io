EliteGuard is going to be an application to protect you from being text bombed. Right now it only prevents against repeated messages, and upper&#47;lower case variations of the same message, with no additional changes, but in the future I plan on improving the spam detection logic to automatically determine if the <a class="zem_slink" title="E-mail bomb" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;E-mail_bomb">text bombing<&#47;a> application is making very slight changes to the original message in order to get around spam filters. I plan on getting EliteGuard into the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.android.com&#47;market&#47;">Android market<&#47;a> soon, although initially, it won't have very many features available. As EliteGuard is right now, it doesn't display logs of messages received, but it does internally keep track of how many of each message was received. Also, EliteGuard is capable of blocking messages received, even if the messages are from different senders. Because EliteGuard is only active when <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;SMS">SMS messages<&#47;a> are received, it has a <em>very<&#47;em> minimal impact on battery life, and the impact on battery lift should actually be less than if you were to receive all of the messages when you were getting text bombed, since there is no longer a need to use precious battery life to vibrate the phone, play a sound, or display an incoming message notification.&Acirc;&nbsp; If you want to be protected against SMS bomb attacks, make sure to download EliteGuard from the Android market when it's available.</p>
