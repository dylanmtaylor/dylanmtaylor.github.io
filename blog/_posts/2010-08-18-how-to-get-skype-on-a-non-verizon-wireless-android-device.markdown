  content: "Apple now has Rhapsody as an app, which is a great start, but it is currently
    hampered by the inability to store locally on your iPod, and has a dismal 64kbps
    bit rate. If this changes, then it will somewhat negate this advantage for the
    Zune, but the 10 songs per month will still be a big plus in Zune Pass' favor.

    interesting article like yours. It is pretty worth enough for me. Personally,
    if all website owners and bloggers made good content as you did, the net will
    be much more useful than ever before.

<p><&#47;div><br />
I don't usually write how-to guides and tutorials on my blog, but this is a really cool (and useful) trick, and I just tried this recently on a friend's <a class="zem_slink" title="AT&amp;T" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.att.com">AT&amp;T<&#47;a> <a class="zem_slink" title="HTC" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.htc.com">HTC<&#47;a> Aria phone, and it works. The reason that this is so important is because <a class="zem_slink" title="Skype" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;skype.com">Skype<&#47;a> Mobile&Acirc;&nbsp; for <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android<&#47;a>&#47;Blackberry devices&Acirc;&nbsp; is currently exclusive to <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon Wireless" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.verizonwireless.com">Verizon Wireless<&#47;a>, and no devices (with the exception of the <a class="zem_slink" title="iPhone" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cnet.com&#47;apple-iphone.html">iPhone<&#47;a>) on other carriers are supposed to have access to it. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Computer software" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Computer_software">software<&#47;a> doesn't work very well, but it's better than nothing.  Keep in mind that this is the "Lite" version of Skype, and it's still in Beta. It's really simple to do this, actually. You just need to go to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;market.android.com&#47;details?id=com.skype.android.lite">the market URL for the unpublished <em>Skype Lite Beta<&#47;em><&#47;a> package, and download it to your phone. That being said, the application has a lot of issues, such as crashing, and it feels incomplete, so it may be better to just hold off on Skype mobile for the moment. For your convenience, here is a <a class="zem_slink" title="QR Code" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;QR_Code">QR code<&#47;a> to make downloading the Skype Lite Beta application easier for those of you who have a <a class="zem_slink" title="Barcode" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Barcode">barcode<&#47;a> scanning application on your Android powered device:</p>
