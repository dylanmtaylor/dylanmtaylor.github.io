<p>I don't usually write how-to guides and tutorials on my blog, but this is a really cool (and useful) trick, and I just tried this recently on a friend's <a class="zem_slink" title="AT&amp;T" rel="homepage" href="http://www.att.com">AT&amp;T</a> <a class="zem_slink" title="HTC" rel="homepage" href="http://www.htc.com">HTC</a> Aria phone, and it works. The reason that this is so important is because <a class="zem_slink" title="Skype" rel="homepage" href="http://skype.com">Skype</a> MobileÂ  for <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a>/Blackberry devicesÂ  is currently exclusive to <a class="zem_slink" title="Verizon Wireless" rel="homepage" href="http://www.verizonwireless.com">Verizon Wireless</a>, and no devices (with the exception of the <a class="zem_slink" title="iPhone" rel="homepage" href="http://www.cnet.com/apple-iphone.html">iPhone</a>) on other carriers are supposed to have access to it. The <a class="zem_slink" title="Computer software" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software">software</a> doesn't work very well, but it's better than nothing.  Keep in mind that this is the "Lite" version of Skype, and it's still in Beta. It's really simple to do this, actually. You just need to go to <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.skype.android.lite">the market URL for the unpublished <em>Skype Lite Beta</em></a> package, and download it to your phone. That being said, the application has a lot of issues, such as crashing, and it feels incomplete, so it may be better to just hold off on Skype mobile for the moment. For your convenience, here is a <a class="zem_slink" title="QR Code" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code">QR code</a> to make downloading the Skype Lite Beta application easier for those of you who have a <a class="zem_slink" title="Barcode" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode">barcode</a> scanning application on your Android powered device:</p>
