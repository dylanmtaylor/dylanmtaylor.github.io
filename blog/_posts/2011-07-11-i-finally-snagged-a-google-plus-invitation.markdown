If&Acirc;&nbsp; not, I suggest you <a href="https:&#47;&#47;plus.google.com&#47;">check out the site<&#47;a> and<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;intl&#47;en&#47;+&#47;demo&#47;"> take the tour<&#47;a>. Google+ will likely forever change the way we interact with friends online, by grouping friends into social "circles" and sharing only certain material with certain groups of friends. In addition to that, another neat feature is "hangouts", where you can have a group video chat with up to 10 different people. Regardless, today I managed to snag an invitation to the service by posting my email address on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;beatweek">Beatweek's Facebook wall<&#47;a>. Less than 5 minutes after posting my email, I had an invitation sitting in my inbox from <a href="https:&#47;&#47;plus.google.com&#47;u&#47;0&#47;113305033825535522724&#47;posts">Bill Palmer<&#47;a>. Shortly after that, I even got a <em>second<&#47;em> invitation to the service from the same person. Unfortunately, because Google wants to limit how many people are on their service, even with an invitation, I couldn't sign up for the service yet, but I'll definitely be checking the Google Plus website frequently to see if I can get in. I'm incredibly excited to try out this new service from Google, and I have incredibly high expectations from it. Anyways, <em>if<&#47;em> I do manage to get in, I'll be happy to invite anyone who requests an invitation from me. I'll update this post (or post another post) once I get into Google+.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:<&#47;strong>&Acirc;&nbsp;I got <a href="http:&#47;&#47;dylanmtaylor.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;07&#47;Screenshot-76.png">a <em>second<&#47;em> invitation<&#47;a> by&Acirc;&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;plus.google.com&#47;u&#47;0&#47;117220625678034723010&#47;posts">Richi Jennings<&#47;a> of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.computerworld.com&#47;18590&#47;get_a_google_invite_here_join_plus_project_circle?ue">Computerworld<&#47;a>, who I emailed before posting on Beatweek's wall, asking for an invite. Thanks Richi! However, I still didn't manage to get into Google+, unfortunately... :(</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:<&#47;strong>&Acirc;&nbsp;I finally managed to sign up for Google+! I'll try to invite everyone who asked me to send them an invitation, but I can't guarantee you'll be able to sign up.</p>
