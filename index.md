### Welcome, please feel free to have a look around.

This website is a living project that I manage as a hobby, in order to learn and explore technology. Everything on dylanmtaylor.com is running on a Linux virtual machine on a KVM host in the cloud. I [deploy the site using Ansible](<https://gitlab.com/dylanmtaylor/dylanmtaylor-ansible>), and the server periodically pulls the source code from the git repository using a cronjob. All the files are served statically using Nginx, and are [dynamically generated at commit time using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.](<https://gitlab.com/dylanmtaylor/dylanmtaylor.gitlab.io/pipelines>)

There is a small blog that I write here, which is written in Markdown. I like to write about projects I work on, share tips and tricks, and discuss relevant news. The entire source code for this site can be studied and used for free.
