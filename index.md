<h3>Welcome to my site, please feel free to have a look around.</h3>

This website is a living project that I manage as a hobby, in order to learn and explore technology.
Everything on dylanmtaylor.com is running on a Linux virtual machine on a KVM host in the cloud.
I <a href="https://gitlab.com/dylanmtaylor/dylanmtaylor-ansible">deploy the site using Ansible</a>, and the server periodically pulls the source code from the git repository
using a cronjob. All the files are served statically using Nginx, and are <a href="https://gitlab.com/dylanmtaylor/dylanmtaylor.gitlab.io/pipelines">dynamically generated at commit time using GitLab CI/CD pipelines.</a>

There is a small blog that I write here, which is written in Markdown.
I like to write about projects I work on, share tips and tricks, and discuss relevant news.
The entire source code for this site can be studied and used for free.
