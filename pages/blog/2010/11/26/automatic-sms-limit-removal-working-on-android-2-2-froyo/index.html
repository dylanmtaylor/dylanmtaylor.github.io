	<h1>Automatic SMS Limit Removal WORKING on Android 2.2 (Froyo)!</h1>
	<p class="meta">26 Nov 2010</p>
	<p>I've been messing around with the <a class="zem_slink" title="SMS" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS</a> limit removal code in EliteBomb Plus on my rooted <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android 2.2</a> device (<a class="zem_slink" title="Samsung i9000 Galaxy S" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_i9000_Galaxy_S">Samsung Epic 4G</a>, running the leaked ROM), and I <em>just</em> managed to get the SMS limit removed <strong>100% automatically</strong>! This is very exciting, as this feature is the #1 request I get. In fact, this feature is so major, that I will be bumping the version number to 3.0 when I get it released to the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>. I have not tested the code for <a class="zem_slink" title="Backward compatibility" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backwards compatibility</a> with devices with Android versions less than 2.2, but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work. This feature will be released first in EliteBomb Plus, and it will be ported over into the free version of EliteBomb shortly afterwards (I like to reward my paying customers). Before I release this, I plan on doing some further testing to ensure that everything does in fact work properly, and it's repeatable. Unfortunately this process involves removing the limit and resetting it to default several times to make sure that it works. There isn't much I can do about that unfortunately. However, I'm really excited to finally have this working, and it's great to be able to release this to make removing the SMS sending limit much easier. Once again, the version with the fixed limit removal will have a version number of 3.0. Look for it in the market <strong>very soon</strong>. I will also be updating InfiniteSMS, since it's mostly the same code. Anyways, I should stop working on writing this, and get back to work. I'm just really excited to have this working! ;)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Version 3.0 of EliteBomb Plus is on the market <em>right now</em>! Check it out in the Android market! :) The free version of EliteBomb should have the fix available very soon. Keep an eye out for it...</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> The fix is now available for the free version of EliteBomb as well! If you don't have it already, I highly recommend downloading it now.<img class="zemanta-pixie-img" style="border: medium none; float: right;" src="/images/blog/2010/12/pixy.gif" alt="" /></p>
