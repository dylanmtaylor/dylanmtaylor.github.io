	<h1>My Opinions On the Leaked Epic 4G Froyo ROM</h1>
	<p class="meta">15 Nov 2010</p>
	<p>There are many changes that <a class="zem_slink" title="Samsung Group" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.samsung.com">Samsung&lt;&#47;a&gt; made to the leaked <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;android&#47;">Android 2.2&lt;&#47;a&gt; (Froyo) <a class="zem_slink" title="Read-only memory" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Read-only_memory">ROM&lt;&#47;a&gt; (link: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forum.xda-developers.com&#47;showthread.php?t=836111"><strong>[ROM] Froyo DJ29 leak, deodexed, zipaligned and pre-rooted v4.2 [11&#47;12]&lt;&#47;strong&gt;&lt;&#47;a&gt;) that I really dislike, and I hope that they change before the official release comes out. This is a list of the things that I noticed so far that significantly degrade the user experience, as well as changes that I absolutely love, and a few suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Samsung replaced the stock <a class="zem_slink" title="Message" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Message">messaging&lt;&#47;a&gt; application with their own custom one that isn't nearly as good or as nice looking. This is actually my number one concern about the new firmware
<ul>
<li>They really need to stop trying to imitate the <a class="zem_slink" title="IPhone" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;IPhone">iPhone's&lt;&#47;a&gt;<a class="zem_slink" title="Look and feel" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Look_and_feel">look and feel&lt;&#47;a&gt;. If we wanted an <a class="zem_slink" title="IPhone" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;IPhone">iPhone&lt;&#47;a&gt;, we would've bought one
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Not only that, but they are also doing a terrible job at mimicking it. In fact, Samsung's new messaging app feels <em>worse&lt;&#47;em&gt; than the one on the iPhone&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The image viewer in the new messaging application is completely broken. It has no ability to zoom in, it shows a progression timer when displaying a still image, images are zoomed out by default, etc.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The best option is to just scrap their messaging app and go back to the stock messaging app, which works flawlessly, and has a very native and natural look and feel&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The new way the applications are arranged in the app drawer is annoyingly unintuitive. Making the user manually rearrange them is not the right way to sell more devices. They were fine before when they were automatically arranged in alphabetical order, but it's really annoying having to manually reposition the icons. There doesn't even seem to be an automatic arrangement option.
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Manual arrangement is fine, as long as the user can choose to have the icons <a class="zem_slink" title="Arrangement" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Arrangement">arrange&lt;&#47;a&gt; automatically.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The new application removal icons are also fine, but really, they should also exist on the pre-installed crapware, since nobody wants <a class="zem_slink" title="NASCAR" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;NASCAR">NASCAR&lt;&#47;a&gt; and <a class="zem_slink" title="Sprint football" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Sprint_football">Sprint Football&lt;&#47;a&gt; Live preloaded anyways.&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The <a class="zem_slink" title="Web browser" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Web_browser">Internet browser&lt;&#47;a&gt; feels incredibly slow and unresponsive now, especially with scrolling. I'm not sure what modifications Samsung made to the browser, but really it would be best to leave it stock, since the stock browser is known to have excellent performance compared to the one in Eclair.
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Also, the new "Internet" icon looks terrible compared to the look and feel of the rest of the operating system. I really prefer the old one.&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The new "News and Weather" application is great. It really is. I love how it automatically locates you via <a class="zem_slink" title="Global Positioning System" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Global_Positioning_System">GPS&lt;&#47;a&gt; and displays relevant weather information, and the tab scrolling at the top of the screen is wonderful.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The new colorful icons in the Settings menu feel very non-native to the platform, but I kind of like them. With less glossiness (I despise glossy icons) and saturation, I could actually become accustomed to them.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">I really like the new voice recorder application they include in the new ROM. It's very simple and easy to use, yet it looks great!&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The Video Player application is also really good, but I experienced some issues with stopping a video that really ruin the user experience. When the back button is pressed, the video should be stopped, and I should be taken back to the list of videos on my device. There should be no need to press an additional on-screen button to stop playing the video. Also, video playback is laggy, and skipping to parts of the video reveals significant delays.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The Memo application is pretty good, but it should allow you to backup memos that you create, either on the device's <a class="zem_slink" title="Secure Digital" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Secure_Digital">SD card&lt;&#47;a&gt;, or to the cloud.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">Getting a GPS position is <em>still flawed&lt;&#47;em&gt;. It takes way too long to get a lock on my position, especially considering how other, lower-end phones such as the Samsung Transform are able to get a quicker <a class="zem_slink" title="Global Positioning System" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Global_Positioning_System">GPS location&lt;&#47;a&gt; that a high-end device like the <a class="zem_slink" title="Samsung i9000 Galaxy S" rel="wikipedia" href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Samsung_i9000_Galaxy_S">Samsung Epic 4G&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">The new AllShare logo looks much better than the old one, but it looks a bit too glossy for my tastes.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">It would be a great addition if Samsung would pre-install the latest version of Google's Voice Search application, which comes with Voice Actions. Sure, users could install that themselves, but it integrates really well with the operating system, and works much better than the version that comes installed. Also, most users won't know to install the version of Voice Search in the market.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">I love the new Silent toggle in the notification bar, but really, it should let you put it in Silent, Vibrate, or Normal (Non-Silent) mode.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">During calls, the proximity sensor sometimes doesn't work correctly, leading to difficulty ending the call.&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li style="text-align: left;">There are often glitches when entering the lock pattern.&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
I will update this list if I notice anything else that should be changed with the new firmware, but really, I'm overall impressed with the new firmware, and I will continue to use it on a day-to-day basis.
<p><strong>UPDATE: &lt;&#47;strong&gt;Very frequently, when pressing on the screen and dragging, the phone will think you let go early, even though you didn't. This is far too common, especially with the lock pattern and Swype, and the problem is incredibly annoying and infuriating.
