	<h1>EliteBomb SUSPENDED From Android Market</h1>
	<p class="meta">27 Dec 2010</p>
	<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Google" rel="homepage" href="http://google.com">Google</a> has decided to pull all three versions of EliteBomb, "Lite", "Plus", and the regular version without any formal notification <em>what-so-ever</em>. In fact, I didn't even realize that my EliteBomb applications had been pulled this <a class="zem_slink" title="Christmas and holiday season" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season">holiday season</a> until I was notified by some of my customers. All I know for sure is that my last EliteBomb Plus order is dated December 22, 2010, which means that the applications were likely pulled between the 22nd and the 23rd. I have no intention of discontinuing support of the applications that have been pulled. I contacted them regarding this matter, but unfortunately, because of the holiday season, or some other unknown reason, I have yet to receive a response from them despite emailing them about it several days ago. Originally, I decided to wait until I received a response from them before writing up anything on my website, but out of frustration and due to emails from some of my <strong>over 45,000</strong> EliteBomb users, I decided to post this anyways to let you guys know what happened. I hope to have EliteBomb back up soon, but if that is not possible, I will likely release a modified version that is acceptable on the <a class="zem_slink" title="Android Market" rel="homepage" href="http://www.android.com/market/">Android market</a>, under a different brand name. I was thinking along the lines of "Phoenix Text Bomber". ;)</p>
