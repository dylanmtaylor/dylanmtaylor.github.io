<h2>Welcome to my site, please feel free to have a look around.</h2>

<p>You can browse the site using any of the links on the left of the page.
This website is a living project that I manage as a hobby, in order to learn and explore technology.
Everything on dylanmtaylor.com is running on a Linux virtual machine on a KVM host in the cloud.
I deploy the site using Ansible, and the server periodically pulls the source code from the git repository
using a cronjob. All the files are served statically using Nginx, and are dynamically generated at commit time using TravisCI.</p>

<p>There is a small Jekyll-powered blog that I write here, which is written in Markdown.
I like to write about projects I work on, share tips and tricks, and discuss relevant news.
The entire source code for this site can be studied and used for free.</p>
