<h2>Welcome to my personal homepage! Have a look around.</h2>

<p>Please feel free to browse the site using any of the links on the left of the page.
If you're looking for my old site, it's no longer available as I rewrote this from scratch.
My blog content that was previously hosted using WordPress has been converted to Jekyll and is still available,
although any links to blog content are now broken, unfortunately. Sorry for the inconvenience.
The entire source code for this site is published on GitHub, and can be studied or used for free.</p>
