<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I'm a software engineer from the suburbs of the great city of <a href="http://pittsburghpa.gov/">Pittsburgh, PA USA</a> with over a decade
of software development experience (I started coding when I was seven) which I've gained from a combination of hobbyist projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/dylanmtaylor/LibreScribe">LibreScribe</a> as well as through software development courses both at <a href="http://www.ptsd.k12.pa.us/">Peters Township High School</a> and <a href="https://psbehrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, the Behrend College</a>. It's always exciting to work on new projects, and I am passionate about the work that I do. I love to experiment and I'm not afraid to try new things even if that means that I will fail. 
</p>

<p>
Throughout all of my software development, I've worked with a wide variety of languages including MIPS and x86 assembly, C, C++, C#, CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Shell Script, TI-Basic, VHDL, VisualBasic, and QBASIC. While I wouldn't consider myself competent in functional programming languages such as Haskell yet, I'm very interested in learning more about them as it's a completely different way of writing code. 
</p>

<p>
Lately my focus has been on Android mobile development as well as virtualization, such as deploying web architecture using Xen Server, KVM or OpenVZ. I have dabbled in OpenStack and the like using my own bare-metal hardware and I find the prospect of more efficiently utilizing the capacity of a server to be fascinating. 
</p>

<p>
I am and have always been a huge proponent of the open source development model. I have been using Linux as my primary operating system on my own computers since I was 12 years old. I started with SlackWare and didn't like that, but quickly discovered Fedora and began to use it as my primary operating system. I'm currently running Linux Mint, as well as a large amount of other free and open source applications. I try to open source as much of my own work as legally possible, and believe that doing so benefits other developers and produces higher quality code.

<p>
I am currently in the job market as an about-to-be graduate of Penn State, and am currently evaluating and applying for prospective careers. If you would like to offer me a position, my r&eacute;sum&eacute; is available on this website, and you can reach me through email by using the contact information on that.
